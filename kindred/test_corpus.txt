These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this malignant tumor. Our study indicated that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of NSCLC patients.
These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients.
Expression of hUTP14a was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and was correlated with pTNM stage of SCC, suggesting that hUTP14a might possess a potential as a candidate marker for the early diagnosis screening of NSCLC.
ZWINT may be a novel target for lung cancer therapy.
P53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival times of cancer patients.
DEGs, including AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, might be potential biomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.
The results of the present study suggest that Wrap53Î± may serve a role in the pathogenesis of a subset of lung cancer, and its methylation may be considered to be a prognostic marker for surgically resected NSCLC patients. However, further studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm this finding.
Our study demonstrates that LINC00342 is involved in the development, and LINC00342 may be a potential diagnostic factor and a target for new therapies for future patients with NSCLC.
This indicates a significant correlation between IL-6 overexpression and cancer development, highlighting the significance of IL-6 in oral, lung, esophageal, and gallbladder carcinomas. IL-6 may be used as a tumor marker for cancer diagnosis. It may be a clinically significant predictor and may represent a target for cancer treatment. However, to definitely conclude this, further extensive studies would be required.
The results of this comprehensive study show both microbiome-gene and microbiome-exposure interactions in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can impair epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortium that is higher in relative abundance in smoking-associated tumors of this type. Given the significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may provide novel biomarkers for early detection.
