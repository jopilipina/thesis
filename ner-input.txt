Ubiquitin activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) is a basic component of E1-activating enzyme in the SUMOylation system. Expression and function of UBA2 in human cancers are largely unknown. In this study we investigate UBA2 expression the function in human non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunochemistry study showed that UBA2 was overexpressed in cancer tissues (53.3%, 40 of 75) compared with normal lung tissues (14.3%, 4 of 28) (P < 0.05). Immunostaining of UBA2 was mainly detected in nucleus. Overexpression of UBA2 in cancer tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation, large tumor size ( > 5.0 cm), higher T stages (T3 + 4), lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages (III + IV). In vitro study showed that UBA2 was expressed in A549, 95D, H1975, and H1299 cells. Knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation and upregulated cancer cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cell significantly increased the G1 and G2/M phase cells and reduced the S phase cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression profile after knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells showed that the most related function was cell cycle, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Western blot analysis study showed that knockdown of UBA2 significantly inhibited expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, mini-chromosome maintenance 7 (MCM7), MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7. These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this malignant tumor.

To investigate the associations between the functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-125 family and the survival of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we systematically selected six functional SNPs located in three pre-miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b-1, miR-125b-2). Cox proportional hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Reporter gene luciferase assay was performed to examine the relationship between the SNPs and transcriptive activity of the miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs in different cells was detected using quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that rs2241490 (upstream of miR-125b-1, G > A, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.014, in dominant model; adjusted HR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.03-1.35, P = 0.014, in additive model), rs512932 (upstream of miR-125b-1, A > G, dominant model: adjusted HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.013) and rs8111742 (upstream of miR-125a, G > A, dominant model: adjusted HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.71-1.00, P = 0.047) were associated with the prognosis of 1001 Chinese NSCLC patients. The combined analysis of the three SNPs related the number of risk alleles (rs2241490-A, rs512932-G and rs8111742-G) to death risk of NSCLC in a locus-dosage mode (P for trend <0.001). Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay showed significantly higher levels of luciferase activity with rs512932 variant G than that with A allele in 293T, SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines. Besides, miR-125b was highly expressed in lung cancer cells than the normal lung cell. Our study indicated that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of NSCLC patients. Larger population-based and functional studies are needed to verify these findings.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS) were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1 Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366 patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87, Cox P = 0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 and 0.36-0.93, Cox P = 0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1 gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC patients.

OBJECTIVE: Human U three protein 14a (hUTP14a) facilitates tumorigenesis through promoting p53 and Rb degradation as well as enhancing c-Myc oncogenic activity. Moreover, hUTP14a expression is up-regulated in human hepatocellular cancer and colorectal cancer tissues. In this study, the expression of hUTP14a in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining (IHC). The relationship between hUTP14a expression levels and the clinical characteristics of the NSCLC patients were analyzed. METHODS: Lung cancer tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues were collected from 123 cases of NSCLC patients including 53 cases of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and 70 cases of adenocarcinoma (ADC), who had accepted surgical resection at Peking University Third Hospital from May 2003 to April 2006. The expression level of hUTP14a was determined by IHC in human NSCLC tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The associations between hUTP14a expression and the clinical pathological variables including gender, age, tumor size, histological type, differentiation degree and clinical pathological stage were analyzed using the Pearson's 2 test. RESULTS: The expression rate of hUTP14a in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher than that in the non-cancerous tissues (37.4% vs. 0, P<0.001). The expressions of hUTP14a in lung ADC and SCC were 48.6% and 20.6%, respectively. The expression rate of hUTP14a in both lung ADC and SCC was significantly higher than that in the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P<0.001). In addition, the expression rate of hUTP14a in lung ADC was significantly higher than that in SCC ( 2=8.66, P=0.003). Furthermore, the expression rate of hUTP14a in the late pTNM stage of SCC was significantly higher than that in the early pTNM stage of SCC while hUTP14a expression level was not associated with pTNM stage of ADC. No correlation was found between hUTP14a expression and the other clinical pathologic features of the patients. CONCLUSION: Expression of hUTP14a was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and was correlated with pTNM stage of SCC, suggesting that hUTP14a might possess a potential as a candidate marker for the early diagnosis screening of NSCLC.

PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the expression of ZWINT, NUSAP1, DLGAP5, and PRC1 in tumor tissues and adjacent tissues with public data. METHODS: The expression patterns of four genes were detected in cancer tissues and adjacent tissues by qRT-PCR. The overall survival analysis was used to explore these genes in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients. Knockdown assays were used to select the most suitable gene among these four genes. Cell function assays with the knockdown gene were conducted in A549 and NCL H226 cells. The role of the knockdown gene in lung cancer was dissected in a mice tumor model. Transcriptome sequencing analyses with the knockdown gene were analyzed. RESULTS: Overexpression of these genes was significantly detected in cancer tissues (P < 0.01). Overall survival revealed that high expression of these genes is closely related with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients (P < 0.05). Knockdown of ZWINT reduced proliferation in NCI H226 and A549 cells (P < 0.05). Knockdown also inhibited cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, and colony formation (P < 0.05). ZWINT knockdown reduced tumor volume (P < 0.05). Transcriptome sequencing of ZWINT knockdown-treated A549 and NCI H226 cells indicated that 100 and 426 differentially expressed genes were obtained, respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested that binding, biological regulation, and multicellular organismal processes were the most enriched. KEGG analysis revealed that TNF, P53, and PI3K signal networks would be the most potential ZWINT-related pathways and were identified by Western blot analysis. CONCLUSIONS: ZWINT may be a novel target for lung cancer therapy.
