CD69 is an activation marker on leukocytes. Early studies showed that the CD69+
cells were detected in the lung of patients with asthmatic and eosinophilic
pneumonia, suggesting that CD69 might play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of
such inflammatory diseases, rather than simply being an activation marker.
Intensive studies using mouse models have since clarified that CD69 is a
functional molecule regulating the immune responses. We discovered that Myosin
light chain 9, 12a, 12b (Myl9/12) are ligands for CD69 and that platelet-derived 
Myl9 forms a net-like structure (Myl9 nets) that is strongly detected inside
blood vessels in inflamed lung. CD69-expressing activated T cells attached to the
Myl9 nets can thereby migrate into the inflamed tissues through a system known as
the CD69-Myl9 system. In this review, we summarize the discovery of the CD69-Myl9
system and discuss how this system is important in inflammatory immune responses.
In addition, we discuss our recent finding that CD69 controls the exhaustion
status of tumor-infiltrating T cells and that the blockade of the CD69 function
enhances anti-tumor immunity. Finally, we discuss the possibility of CD69 as a
new therapeutic target for patients with intractable inflammatory disorders and
tumors.

CASE REPORT: Case 1 of an investigator-initiated study using oral single agent
mifepristone to halt stage IV non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor was devoid
of any targeted markers has remained ECOG zero and in good health for over 3
years. Case 2, reported here, is a 68-year-old woman with stage IV non-small cell
lung cancer whose tumor was positive for the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
marker. Her cancer progressed despite treatment with a check-point inhibitor
(nivolumab), besides 3 rounds of multi-agent chemotherapy. After 1 ½ years of
treatment with single agent mifepristone, her cancer remains stable (even some
tumor regression) and her quality of life is only impaired by her pre-existing
chronic obstructive lung disease, not her cancer.
CONCLUSION: Mifepristone therapy may provide a method to halt metastatic lung
cancer positive for the PD-L1 marker when check-point inhibitors are no longer
effective.

EZH2 is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which
catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and promotes
carcinogenesis by epigenetically silencing many tumor suppressor genes. Increased
EZH2 expression is a marker of advanced and metastatic in many cancers, including
lung, prostate and breast cancer, and it has been considered as a potential novel
therapeutic target. However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms
of EZH2 controlling gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are not well
documented. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to
investigate the EZH2 expression in gastric cancer. We found that EZH2 levels were
increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
Moreover, patients with high levels of EZH2 expression had a relatively poor
prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown of EZH2 expression by siRNA could impair cell
proliferation and invasion both in vitro and vivo. Finally, we found that EZH2
influences gastric cancer cells proliferation partly through regulating p21
expression. Our findings present that EZH2 over-expression can be identified as a
poor prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer.

Multiplex electrochemical sensors for amperometric detection of glutathione
disulfide (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cyss),
β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) and coenzyme II reduced
tetrasodium salt (NADPH) were developed, in which analysis of Cyss, NADP+ and
NADPH are the first report using this sensing system. Specificity of these
sensors were ensured by a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was 
electropolymerized in situ with the analytes as template. All the sensors were
tested with standard buffers and mouse blood samples, showing satisfactory
performance towards the corresponding analytes. Dynamic concentration for the six
analytes was in the range of 10-11-10-8 mol/L with the detection limit down to 20
pmol/L. In addition, artificially synthesized MIP film on the electrodes allowed 
for good selectivity and stability. Real blood sample measurement proved that the
sensors owned decent accuracy with recovery value ranging from 92%~112%. More
importantly, blood samples from lung cancer patients and healthy donors were
assayed by using the proposed sensors. Redox potentials (Ehc) were calculated
based on the contents of these endogenic substances, which were utilized to
reflect the health status of human body and help diagnose lung cancer. The levels
of GSH, NADPH and the absolute value of Ehc(GSH/GSSG) in patients with lung
cancer are significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those in healthy people, while the
contents of GSSG (P < 0.01) are higher. The blood test results suggested that the
content of GSH, NADPH, NADP+ and Ehc(GSH/GSSG) might serve as biomarkers for lung
cancer prediagnosis. These novel sensors for liquid biospy of cancer have
cost-benefit and scalability advantage over current techniques, potentially
enabling broader clinical access and efficient population screening.

BACKGROUND: Development of noninvasive biomarkers could potentially contribute to
extending the 5-year overall survival rate of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), due to their high stability, have the
potential to become valuable cancer biomarkers.
METHODS: Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
testing three methods for data normalization, the expression levels of six miRNAs
were evaluated in serum samples obtained from 50 NSCLC patients. Subsequently,
the clinical significance of tested miRNAs was determined.
RESULTS: Significant downregulation of miR-21-5p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-126-3p and 
upregulation of miR-210-3p and miR-486-5p in serum samples of NSCLC patients were
identified in comparison to healthy controls. miR-205-5p appeared to be
undetectable in all tested samples. Furthermore, miR-210-3p was differentially
expressed between two subtypes of NSCLC. Receiver operating characteristic
analysis for miR-210-3p revealed the area under the curve of 0.842 (95%
confidence interval, 0.72-0.96; p = 0.0003) and demonstrated that miR-210-3p
displayed considerable accuracy in discriminating serum of lung adenocarcinoma
(AC) patients from serum of healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this preliminary study indicate that five of six
tested miRNAs were deregulated in serum of NSCLC patients. Moreover, miR-210-3p
appears to be a promising biomarker for diagnosis of lung AC.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is a highly aggressive cancer with a poor prognosis and
is associated with distant metastasis; however, there are no clinically
recognized biomarkers for the early diagnosis and prediction of lung cancer
metastasis. We sought to identify the differential mitochondrial protein profiles
and understand the molecular mechanisms governing lung cancer metastasis.
METHODS: Mitochondrial proteomic analysis was performed to screen and identify
the differential mitochondrial protein profiles between human large cell lung
cancer cell lines with high (L-9981) and low (NL-9980) metastatic potential by
two-dimensional differential gel electrophoresis. Western blot was used to
validate the differential mitochondrial proteins from the two cells.
Bioinformatic proteome analysis was performed using the Mascot search engine and 
messenger RNA expression of the 37 genes of the differential mitochondrial
proteins were detected by real-time PCR.
RESULTS: Two hundred and seventeen mitochondrial proteins were differentially
expressed between L-9981 and NL-9980 cells (P < 0.05). Sixty-four analyzed
proteins were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of
flight mass spectrometry coupled with database interrogation. Ontology analysis
revealed that these proteins were mainly involved in the regulation of
translation, amino acid metabolism, tricarboxylic acid cycle, cancer invasion and
metastasis, oxidative phosphorylation, intracellular signaling pathway, cell
cycle, and apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the incorporation of more samples and new
datasets will permit the definition of a collection of proteins as potential
biomarkers for the prediction and diagnosis of lung cancer metastasis.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) mediate intercellular communication via transferring
proteins and other biological molecules and have been recently investigated as
biomarkers of disease. Sensitive and specific biomarkers are required for lung
cancer diagnosis and prognosis. The present study screened for abnormal EV
proteins in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using a quantitative proteomics
strategy involving LC-MS/MS to identify ideal biomarkers for NSCLC diagnosis. EVs
were enriched from the sera of early and advanced NSCLC patients and healthy
controls and from cell culture supernatants of lung adenocarcinoma and bronchial 
epithelial cell lines. In the sera and supernatants, 279 and 632 differentially
expressed proteins, respectively, were associated with signaling pathways
including extracellular membrane-receptor interaction, focal adhesion, and
regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. Thirty-two EV proteins were identified at
the intersection of differentially expressed proteins between the NSCLC groups
and cell lines. Based on bioinformatics analysis, in silico immunohistochemical
and PRM verification, fibronectin was selected for following in vitro studies and
validation with an independent cohort. Fibronectin on EVs was estimated to
perform well in the diagnosis of NSCLC patients based on AUC, showing great
potential for clinical use and demonstrating the efficacy of this method for
EV-associated biomarker screening. This article is protected by copyright. All

Hypoxia plays an extensive role in the development of the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), particularly in mediating immunosuppression. Respiratory hyperoxia therapy
has the potential to improve the effects of conventional cancer therapies via
molecular mechanisms mediating antitumor immunity. Here, we investigated whether 
hyperoxia therapy can restore tumor immunity and inhibit lung metastases in a
mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by treating a 4T1 mammary
carcinoma mouse model with normoxia (21% oxygen) or hyperoxia (60% oxygen)
therapy, after tumor development. Using flow cytometry analysis, we observed
significant organ-specific expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
and protein expression upregulation of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in
the hypoxic TME of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice maintained under normoxia conditions,
with the TME converting to a T-cell immune-suppressive state as early as the
premetastatic phase. Markedly, hyperoxia treatments ameliorated hypoxia levels in
the lung TME and decreased the proportion of MDSCs and the expression of PD-L1 in
both the primary tumor and in the metastatic lung, when compared to animals
treated with respiratory normoxia therapy. In addition, the number of lung
metastatic nodes fell from 90 per lung in the normoxic treated group to 13 per
lung in the hyperoxic treated group (P < 0.05), with the latter having limited
hyperoxia effects on primary tumor growth (mammary glands). Notably, hyperoxia
therapy was characterized by the differential recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+
T-cells. Thus, our study confirms that hyperoxia therapy may be used to overcome 
TME immunosuppression and control the extend of lung metastases in TNBC.
Importantly, changes in immunosuppressive MDSCs frequency and PD-L1 expression
levels may serve as biomarkers of hypoxia levels in cancer affected tissues that 
can benefit from hyperoxia treatments.

Long follow up is needed in prospective cohort study evaluation of plasma
biomarkers for incident peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Middle-aged PAD-free
individuals from the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study
(n = 5550; 1991-94) were followed prospectively for a median time of 23.4 years. 
The plasma biomarkers lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity 
and mass, proneurotensin, and CRP, were studied in relation to incidence of PAD
until December 31st, 2016. The diagnosis of PAD could be validated and confirmed 
in 98%. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) per 1 standard
deviation increment of each respective log transformed plasma biomarker.
Cumulative incidence of PAD was 4.4% (men 5.9%, women 3.3%). Adjusting for age,
gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Lp-PLA2
activity (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.17-1.52), Lp-PLA2 mass (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37)
and CRP (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.36-1.76) remained independently associated with
incident PAD. The plasma biomarkers Lp-PLA2 activity and mass, and CRP were
markers of PAD risk, implying that they might be useful biomarkers for
subclinical atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the expression of vinculin in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to analyze its correlation with clinical features
and prognosis of NSCLC.
METHODS: The expression of vinculin in cancer tissues and paracancer tissues was 
detected by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.
Correlations between vinculin-positive expression and clinical features were
analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis, and those between vinculin expression
and prognosis were analyzed by Cox multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Vinculin expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in
paracancer tissues. Pearson correlation analysis showed that vinculin expression 
was significantly correlated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph
node metastasis in NSCLC. Cox multivariate analysis showed that vinculin-negative
expression and TNM stage were independent risk factors for NSCLC prognosis.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was
20.51% for all NSCLC patients, and was significantly higher for vinculin-positive
patients with NSCLC than vinculin-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Vinculin gene transcription is inhibited in NSCLC, and low vinculin 
expression promotes malignancy in NSCLC. Therefore, vinculin could be used as a
prognostic marker for NSCLC and a potential target for its treatment.

Biofield therapies have gained popularity and are being explored as possible
treatments for cancer. In some cases, devices have been developed that mimic the 
electromagnetic fields that are emitted from people delivering biofield
therapies. However, there is limited research examining if humans could
potentially inhibit the proliferation of cancer cells and suppress tumor growth
through modification of inflammation and the immune system. We found that human
NSCLC A549 lung cancer cells exposed to Sean L. Harribance, a purported healer,
showed reduced viability and downregulation of pAkt. We further observed that the
experimental exposure slowed growth of mouse Lewis lung carcinoma evidenced by
significantly smaller tumor volume in the experimental mice (274.3 ± 188.9 mm3)
than that of control mice (740.5 ± 460.2 mm3; P < .05). Exposure to the
experimental condition markedly reduced tumoral expression of pS6, a cytosolic
marker of cell proliferation, by 45% compared with that of the control group.
Results of reversed phase proteomic array suggested that the experimental
exposure downregulated the PD-L1 expression in the tumor tissues. Similarly, the 
serum levels of cytokines, especially MCP-1, were significantly reduced in the
experimental group ( P < .05). Furthermore, TILs profiling showed that CD8+/CD4- 
immune cell population was increased by almost 2-fold in the experimental
condition whereas the number of intratumoral CD25+/CD4+ (T-reg cells) and CD68+
macrophages were 84% and 33%, respectively, lower than that of the control group.
Together, these findings suggest that exposure to purported biofields from a
human is capable of suppressing tumor growth, which might be in part mediated
through modification of the tumor microenvironment, immune function, and
anti-inflammatory activity in our mouse lung tumor model.

BACKGROUND: Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is an important plaque component of desmosomes, 
major intercellular adhesive junctions that act as anchorage points for
intermediate filaments. Abnormal expression of PKP1 was observed in various types
of cancer, however so far its function in lung cancer has not yet been
elucidated.
METHODS: The expression of PKP1 was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting in
lung cancer cell lines. The protein expression of PKP1 was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray. The epigenetic mechanism of PKP1 was
explored by demethylation test, bisulfite sequencing and
Methylation-Specific-PCR. The function of PKP1 was investigated by stable
transfection with an expression vector.
RESULTS: We found that PKP1 was downregulated in 6 out of 8 lung cancer cell
lines, and downregulation of PKP1 was associated with DNA hypermethylation. In
advanced primary lung tumor samples, higher expression of PKP1 was significantly 
associated with favorable clinical outcome (p = .003). Ectopic expression of PKP1
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion and enhanced
apoptosis. These phenomena are accompanied by increased caspase 3/7 activities
and cleaved PARP-1 as well as decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activity.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that PKP1 is a novel tumor
suppressor and its protein expression might be a potential prognostic marker for 
patients with advanced lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Genetic alterations, including mutation of epidermal growth factor
receptor or v-Ki-ras2 kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog and fusion of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), RET proto-oncogene (RET), or v-ros UR2 sarcoma 
virus oncogene homolog 1 (ROS1), occur in non-small cell lung cancers, and these 
oncogenic drivers are important biomarkers for targeted therapies. A useful
technique to screen for these fusions is the detection of native carboxy-terminal
(C-terminal) protein by immunohistochemistry; however, the effects of other
genetic alterations on C-terminal expression is not fully understood. In this
study, we evaluated whether C-terminal expression is specifically elevated by
fusion with or without typical genetic alterations of lung cancer.
METHODS: In 37 human lung cancer cell lines and four tissue specimens, protein
and mRNA levels were measured by capillary western blotting and reverse
transcription-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, mRNA levels at the
C-terminus of all five of the fusion-positive cell lines tested (three ALK, one
RET, and one ROS1) were elevated at least 2000-, 300-, or 2000-fold,
respectively, and high C-terminal protein expression was detected. In an ALK
fusion-positive tissue specimen, the mRNA and protein levels of C-terminal ALK
were also markedly elevated. Meanwhile, in one of 36 RET fusion-negative cell
lines, RET mRNA levels at the C-terminus were elevated at least 500-fold compared
with the median of all 37 cell lines, and high C-terminal protein expression was 
detected despite the absence of RET fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of 37 cell lines and four tissue specimens shows the
detection of C-terminal ALK or ROS1 proteins could be a comprehensive method to
determine ALK or ROS1 fusion, whereas not only the detection of C-terminal RET
protein but also other methods would be needed to determine RET fusion.

PURPOSE: The management of advanced lung cancer has evolved tremendously over the
past two decades. Increasing understanding of the molecular changes that drive
tumor progression has transformed the treatment of this disease. Nevertheless,
various countries differ in the degree of implementation of genetic tests and the
availability of innovative drugs. The LungCARD consortium created a questionnaire
to collect information about the local research and clinical practices related to
lung cancer diagnosis and therapy.
METHODS: A survey composed of 37 questions related to specific lung cancer
pharmacogenomics and therapy, was distributed among 18 countries.
RESULTS: All together 36 responses were gathered, answered mainly by clinicians. 
The majority attends 50-200 cancer cases per month, 20-50% of all cancer cases
are lung cancer patients, and more than 80% are with non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Targeted therapy is applied to 50% on average of all NSCLC patients.
Forty five percent of participating medical oncologists are treating their
patients with immunotherapy. More than 90% of the respondents are guided by
results of genetic tests in introducing targeted treatment. As expected, the
majority orders EGFR gene testing (85%), followed by ALK (58%) and KRAS testing
(32%). Almost all (96%) agreed that more biomarkers should be included in routine
genetic testing (ROS1, anti-PDL1, KRAS, MET, HER2, BRAF...), and that blood test 
is useful in pharmacogenomic testing.
CONCLUSION: There is a great variation between countries with respect to all
discussed topics. However, the majority recognized a necessity of introducing
next generation sequencing (NGS)-based diagnostics and potential of testing from 
blood. The biggest problem in the treatment of NSCLC is still an access to
innovative drugs.

Reactive oxygen species (ROS) are implicated in the aetiology of interstitial
lung disease (ILD). We investigated the role of large-scale somatically acquired 
mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and consecutive respiratory chain
dysfunction as a trigger of ROS-formation and lung fibrosis. Mitochondria were
analysed in lung biopsies from 30 patients with idiopathic or connective tissue
disease (CTD)-related ILD and 13 controls. In 17 patients we had paired biopsies 
from upper and lower lobes. Control samples were taken from lung cancer
resections without interstitial fibrosis. Malondialdehyde, a marker of
ROS-formation, was elevated in ILD-biopsies (p = 0.044). The activity of the
mitochondrial respiratory chain (cytochrome c-oxidase/succinate dehydrogenase
[COX/SDH]-ratio) was depressed in ILD (median = 0.10,) compared with controls
(0.12, p < 0.001), as was the expression of mtDNA-encoded COX-subunit-2 protein
normalized for the nucleus-encoded COX-subunit-4 (COX2/COX4-ratio;
ILD-median = 0.6; controls = 2.2; p < 0.001). Wild-type mtDNA copies were
slightly elevated in ILD (p = 0.088). The common mtDNA deletion was only present 
at low levels in controls (median = 0%) and at high levels in ILD (median = 17%; 
p < 0.001). In ILD-lungs with paired biopsies, lower lobes contained more
malondialdehyde and mtDNA deletions than upper lobes and had lower
COX2/COX4-ratios and COX/SDH-ratios (all p < 0.001). Acquired mtDNA-mutations and
consecutive respiratory chain dysfunction may both trigger and perpetuate
ROS-formation in ILD.

BACKGROUND: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B), a novel 
oncogene, promotes tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic biomarker in
several cancers. This study was to determine the clinical significance and
biological roles of LAPTM4B in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC).
METHODS: LAPTM4B expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 63 LAC 
tumors. Serum levels of LAPTM4B were measured by enzyme-linked immuosorbent
assays (ELISA). The study included untreated group (n = 216), chemotherapy group 
(n = 29), chemotherapy efficacy group (n = 179), EGFR-TKIs group (n = 57) and 68 
healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the correlation
between LAPTM4B expression and clinicopathological parameters in LAC.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of
LAPTM4B in LAC. In vitro assays were performed to assess the biological roles of 
LAPTM4B in LAC cells. Western blotting assays were examined to identify the
underlying pathways involved in the tumor-promoting role of LAPTM4B.
RESULTS: We found LAPTM4B was upregulated in LAC tissues and high LAPTM4B
expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Serum LAPTM4B levels
were significantly decreased after chemotherapy. Patients in invalid response
group showed higher LAPTM4B levels than the valid response group. Overexpression 
of LAPTM4B promoted, while silencing of LAPTM4B inhibited proliferation, invasion
and migration of LAC cells via PI3K/AKT and EMT signals. LAPTM4B expression level
was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. In
addition, LAPTM4B plays important roles in EGFR-promoted cell proliferation,
migration and invasion and gefitinib-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data propose that LAPTM4B may be a cancer
biomarker for LAC and a potential therapeutic target which facilitates the
development of a novel therapeutic strategy against LAC.

PURPOSE: The detection of pre-existing EGFR T790M subclones and the assessment of
their clinical significance in the pretreatment of EGFR T790M non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients remain unclear.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 179 tumor samples from patients treated or not
with a first-generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) was analyzed. The
presence of ultra-low levels of pre-existing EGFRT790M mutation was evaluated
using ultra-sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and the clinical implication of
these mutations on first-generation TKI efficiency assessed.
RESULTS: With a ddPCR linear performance of 0.999 and an analytical sensitivity
of approximately 0.001%, we observed a 66% (99/150) overall incidence of
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutation. Among 82 patients harboring EGFR activating
mutations, the presence of a pre-existing EGFR T790M mutation prior to any
treatment was significantly associated with a longer PFS (P = 0.009; Log-rank
test). Interestingly, longer PFS was linked to concomitant EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations. Moreover, the presence of both EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations was identified as the best fit for predicting the 
clinical outcome of patients treated with TKI compared with an ultra-low EGFR
T790M mutation status or an activating mutation alone (P = 0.042 and P = 0.0071, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the detection of the ultra-low EGFR T790M
mutation in TKI-naive patients is not a rare event. We suggest that ddPCR should 
be used in clinical practice to distinguish patients who may respond to first- or
third-generation TKIs.

Checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy is opening a promising scenario in
oncology, with objective responses registered in multiple cancer types. However, 
reliable predictive markers of tumor responsiveness are still lacking. These
markers need to be urgently identified for a better selection of patients that
can be candidates for immunotherapy. In this pilot study, a cohort of 34
consecutive patients bearing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab, was considered. The
retrospective immuno-phenotypic analysis performed on the original tumor biopsies
allowed for the identification of a specific "galectin signature", which strongly
correlated with tumor responsiveness to anti PD-1 immunotherapy. We observed that
the large majority of patients (about 90%) with high galectin-3 tumor expression 
(score 3+) showed an early and dramatic progression of the disease after three
cycles of treatments. In contrast, all patients with negative or low/intermediate
expression of galectin-3 in tumor cells showed an early and durable objective
response to pembrolizumab, indicating galectin-3 as an interesting predictive
marker of tumor responsiveness. The galectin-3 signature, at least in NSCLCs,
promises a better selection of patient candidates for immunotherapy, reducing
unnecessary treatment exposures and social costs. A large multicenter study is
ongoing to validate this finding.

Lung cancer, one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide has long
relied on testing for the molecular biomarkers EGFR/ALK. However, achieving
superior clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer requires developing
comprehensive techniques beyond contemporary EGFR/ALK testing. Current
technologies are on par with molecular testing for EGFR/ALK in terms of efficacy,
most of them failing to offer improvements perhaps primarily due to skepticism
among clinicians, despite being recommended in the NCCN guidelines. The present
study endeavored to minimize chemotherapy-dependence in EGFR/ALK-negative patient
cohorts, and use evidence-based methods to identify ways to improve clinical
outcomes. In total, 137 lung cancer cases obtained from 'PositiveSelect NGS
data', comprising 91 males and 46 females, were investigated. EGFR- and
ALK-positivity was used for data dichotomization to understand the therapeutic
utility of rare gene alterations beyond just EGFR/ALK. Statistics obtained from
PositiveSelect were collated with data from international studies to construct a 
meta-analysis intended to achieve better clinical outcomes. Upon dichotomization,
23% of cases harbored EGFR variants indicating that treating with EGFR TKIs would
be beneficial; the remaining 77% exhibited no EGFR variants that would indicate
favorable results using specific currently available chemotherapy practices.
Similarly, 28% of cases had EGFR+ALK variants favoring EGFR/ALK-based targeted
therapeutics; the remaining 72% harbored no EGFR/ALK variants with known
beneficial chemotherapy routes. The present study aimed to overcome current
inadequacies of targeted therapies in patients with a conventional
EGFR/ALK-positive diagnosis and those in EGFR+ALK-negative cohorts. Upon analysis
of the negative cohorts, significant and clinically relevant single nucleotide
variants were identified in KRAS, ERBB2, MET and RET, with frequencies of 7, 1, 2
and 3% in patients who were EGFR-negative and 6, 1, 1, and 3% in patients who
were EGFR and ALK-negative, respectively, enabling the use of targeted
therapeutics aside from EGFR/ALK TKIs. From the results of the current study only
35% of the two negative arms (EGFR negative and EGFR+ALK negative) would be
recommended NCCN or off-label chemotherapy; prior to the current study, the
entire cohorts would have been recommended this treatment. The present study
emphasizes the potential of comprehensive genomics in identifying hallmarks of
lung cancer beyond EGFR/ALK, using broad-spectrum genetic testing and
data-sharing among medical professionals to circumvent ineffective chemotherapy.

Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, P.R. China.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential prognostic value of
members of the heat shock protein (HSP)90 family in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients. The mRNA expression profiles of 1,926 NSCLC patients, which was
available from the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, were included in the study.
High expression of HSP90AA1 mRNA was significantly associated with a poorer rate 
of overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients [hazard ratio (HR), 1.21; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.37; P=0.004], as well as for patients with
adenocarcinoma (ADE; HR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.02-1.65; P=0.034), but no significant
correlation was identified for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (HR, 1.08; 
95% CI: 0.85-1.38; P=0.51). High expression of HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 mRNA was
significantly associated with poorer rates of OS in lung SCC and ADE patients
combined, as well as in lung ADE patients alone. By contrast, high expression of 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) mRNA was
significantly associated with improved OS rates in all NSCLC patients combined
(HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P=0.041), as well as ADE patients. In stratified
survival analysis, a high expression of HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 predicted 
poor prognosis in stage I NSLCC patients, suggesting that these genes may serve
as stage-independent prognostic indicators. As an elevated expression of
HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSP90B1 and TRAP1 was associated with poorer OS outcomes in
patients with NSCLC, these HSP90 members may be potential prognostic biomarkers
and drug targets for the treatment of NSCLC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver
with high mortality and frequent recurrence. Although various therapies provide
potential cure for HCC patients, unfortunately the five-year survival rate of
advanced HCC remains dismal. It is critical to explore the pathogenesis of HCC
and identify novel biomarkers for early HCC diagnosis. PSMD4 is a major receptor 
of the 26S proteasome involved in ubiquitindependent and proteasome-mediated
protein degradation. In our study, PSMD4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and
cell lines determined by Northern blot, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
The silencing of PSMD4 blocked cell proliferation and tumor growth, induced cell 
apoptosis and inhibited the proteasome activity. Western blot results showed that
the knockdown of PSMD4 blocked the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2),
phosphorylated Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (P-SRC) and Bcl-2, but improved the levels
of p53 and Bax in HCC, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and
endometrial cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicated that the 
subunit of 26S proteasome PSMD4 exerts as an oncogene in HCC and other cancers
via regulating the expression p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. These findings enriched the
pathogenesis of HCC, and provided a new biomarker for cancers diagnosis and a new
target for cancers therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Orthopedia homeobox protein (OTP) was recently demonstrated to be a
pulmonary neuroendocrine marker showing specificity for pulmonary carcinoid
tumors in histologic sections. Little is known of OTP performance and specificity
for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors in lung fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cell
blocks (CBs), however.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated OTP expression in lung non-neuroendocrine and
neuroendocrine tumor CBs to determine its diagnostic utility in these specimens. 
Pulmonary typical carcinoid (TC) and atypical carcinoid (AC), small-cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and squamous cell 
carcinoma (SQ) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) CBs were retrieved along with matched
surgical cases and assessed for nuclear OTP expression with immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 11) and 83% ACs (10 of 12), but
not in SCLC (0 of 9), LCNEC (0 of 9), SQ (0 of 10) or ADC (0 of 6) cytology
cases. Similar to the cytologic specimens, nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 
11) and 80% ACs (8 of 10) but in none of the SCLC (0 of 8), LCNEC (0 of 7), SQ (0
of 8) or ADC (0 of 6) resections. Both AC and TC CBs showed a similar percentage 
of cells expressing nuclear OTP. By contrast, in resection specimens, 30% ACs (3 
of 10) compared with 73% TC (8 of 11) cases showed >40% of cells nuclear OTP
staining. Nuclear OTP demonstrated 80-83% sensitivity and 100% specificity for
pulmonary carcinoid tumors in cytology and surgical specimens.
CONCLUSION: In the context of pulmonary malignancies, nuclear OTP
immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive and specific in distinguishing carcinoid
tumors from other pulmonary neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine malignancies in
cytologic and surgical specimens.

PURPOSE: Real-time image guided adaptive radiation therapy (IGART) requires
accurate marker segmentation to resolve 3D motion based on 2D fluoroscopic
images. Most common marker segmentation methods require prior knowledge of marker
properties to construct a template. If marker properties are not known, an
additional learning period is required to build the template which exposes the
patient to an additional imaging dose. This work investigates a deep
learning-based fiducial marker classifier for use in real-time IGART that
requires no prior patient-specific data or additional learning periods. The
proposed tracking system uses convolutional neural network (CNN) models to
segment cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped fiducial markers.
METHODS: The tracking system uses a tracking window approach to perform sliding
window classification of each implanted marker. Three cylindrical marker training
datasets were generated from phantom kilovoltage (kV) and patient intrafraction
images with increasing levels of megavoltage (MV) scatter. The cylindrical shaped
marker CNNs were validated on unseen kV fluoroscopic images from twelve fractions
of ten prostate cancer patients with implanted gold fiducials. For the training
and validation of the arbitrarily shaped marker CNNs, cone beam computed
tomography (CBCT) projection images from ten fractions of seven lung cancer
patients with implanted coiled markers were used. The arbitrarily shaped marker
CNNs were trained using three patients and the other four unseen patients were
used for validation. The effects of full training using a compact CNN (four
layers with learnable weights) and transfer learning using a pretrained CNN
(AlexNet, eight layers with learnable weights) were analyzed. Each CNN was
evaluated using a Precision-Recall curve (PRC), the area under the PRC plot (AUC)
and by the calculation of sensitivity and specificity. The tracking system was
assessed using the validation data and the accuracy was quantified by calculating
the mean error and root-mean-square-error (RMSE) and the 1st and 99th percentiles
of the error.
RESULTS: The fully trained CNN on the dataset with moderate noise levels had a
sensitivity of 99.00% and specificity of 98.92%. Transfer learning of AlexNet
resulted in a sensitivity and specificity of 99.42% and 98.13% respectively for
the same datasets. For the arbitrarily shaped marker CNNs, the sensitivity was
98.58% and specificity was 98.97% for the fully trained CNN. The transfer
learning CNN had a sensitivity and specificity of 98.49% and 99.56% respectively.
The CNNs were successfully incorporated into a multiple object tracking system
for both cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped markers. The cylindrical shaped
marker tracking had a mean RMSE of 1.6±0.2 pixels and 1.3±0.4 pixels in the x-
and y-directions respectively. The arbitrarily shaped marker tracking had a mean 
RMSE of 3.0±0.5 pixels and 2.2±0.4 pixels in the x- and y-directions
respectively.
CONCLUSION: With deep learning CNNs, high classification performances on unseen
patient images were achieved for both cylindrical and arbitrarily shaped markers.
Furthermore, the application of CNN models to intrafraction monitoring was
demonstrated using a simple tracking system. The results demonstrate that CNN
models can be used to track markers without prior knowledge of the marker
properties or an additional learning period. This article is protected by

Arecoline is the primary alkaloid in betel nuts, which are known as a risk factor
for oral submucosal fibrosis and oral cancer. Lung cancer is a severe type of
carcinoma with high cell motility that is difficult to treat. However, the
detailed mechanisms of the correlation between Arecoline and lung cancer are not 
fully understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Arecoline on migration in
lung cancer cell lines and its potential mechanism through the muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor 3 (mAChR3)-triggered EGFR/Src/FAK pathway. Our results
indicate that different concentrations of Arecoline treatment (10 µM, 20 µM, and 
40 µM) significantly increased the cell migration ability in A549 and CL1-0 cells
and promoted the formation of the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton, which
is a crucial element for cell migration. However, migration of H460, CL1-5, and
H520 cell lines, which have a higher migration ability, was not affected by
Arecoline treatment. The EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway, which is responsible for cell
migration, was activated by Arecoline treatment, and a decreased expression level
of E-cadherin, which is an epithelial marker, was observed in Arecoline-treated
cell lines. Blockade of the EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway with the inhibitors of EGFR
(Gefitinib) or c-Src (Dasatinib) significantly prevented Arecoline-promoted
migration in A549 cells. Gefitinib or Dasatinib treatment significantly disrupted
the Arecoline-induced localization of phospho-Y576-Fak during focal adhesion in
A549 cells. Interestingly, Arecoline-promoted migration in A549 cells was blocked
by a specific mAChR3 inhibitor (4-DAMP) or a neutralizing antibody of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP7 or Matrilysin). Taken together, our findings suggest that
mAChR3 might play an essential role in Arecoline-promoted EGFR/c-Src/Fak
activation and migration in an A549 lung cancer cell line.

Smoking cessation prolongs survival and decreases mortality of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, epigenetic alterations of some
genes are associated with survival. However, potential interactions between
smoking cessation and epigenetics have not been assessed. Here, we conducted an
epigenome-wide interaction analysis between DNA methylation and smoking cessation
on NSCLC survival. We used a two-stage study design to identify DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interactions that affect overall survival for
early-stage NSCLC. The discovery phase contained NSCLC patients from USA, Spain, 
Norway, and Sweden. A histology-stratified Cox proportional hazards model
adjusted for age, sex, clinical stage, and study center was used to test DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interaction terms. Interactions with FDR-q ≤ 0.05
were further confirmed in a validation phase using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database. Histology-specific interactions were identified by stratification
analysis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
patients. We identified one CpG probe (cg02268510SIPA 1L3 ) that significantly
and exclusively modified the effect of smoking cessation on survival in LUAD
patients (HRinteraction = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07-1.16; P = 4.30×10-7 ). Further, the 
effect of smoking cessation on early-stage LUAD survival varied across patients
with different methylation levels of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Smoking cessation only 
benefited LUAD patients with low methylation (HR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.82; P =
4.61×10-3 ) rather than medium or high methylation (HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.86-1.70;
P = 0.266) of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Moreover, there was an antagonistic
interaction between elevated methylation of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 and smoking
cessation (HRinteraction = 2.1835; 95% CI: 1.27-3.74; P = 4.46 × 10-3 ). In
summary, smoking cessation benefited survival of LUAD patients with low
methylation at cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . The results have implications for not only
smoking cessation after diagnosis, but also possible methylation-specific drug
targeting.

PURPOSE: Cancer stem cells (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
pathways are crucial for cancer progression. However, synergistic interactions
between CSC and EMT are not clear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study was to investigate CSC markers such as CD44, NANOG, and
ALDH1 expression and its correlation with EMT markers in NSCLC patients. Its
association with survival was also determined.
METHODS: CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 protein expression was evaluated in 267 resected 
NSCLC and its correlation with e-cadherin, β-catenin, p120 catenin, vimentin,
SNAIL, and TWIST expressions was determined based on immunohistochemical and mRNA
expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analyses
also were performed based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data from
Gene Expression Omnibus dataset.
RESULTS: ALDH1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was positively correlated with
the epithelial-like phenotype, low vimentin and low TWIST in immunohistochemical 
and mRNA expression data. NANOG and ALDH1 expressions measured by
immunohistochemical and mRNA expression profiling data of adenocarcinomas were
associated with a favorable prognosis. ALDH1 was an independent favorable
prognostic marker for overall survival or recurrence-free survival in
adenocarcinoma (P = 0.026 and P = 0.033, respectively). The epithelial-like
phenotype expressing P120-catenin and beta-catenin was associated with a
favorable prognosis; however, the TWIST-expressing mesenchymal-like phenotype was
correlated with an unfavorable prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: NANOG and ALDH1 protein or mRNA expression showed improved prognosis
in adenocarcinoma alone. ALDH1 expression correlated with an epithelial-like
phenotype.

PURPOSE: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity (RICT) is an increasingly
well-appreciated source of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving thoracic
radiotherapy (RT). Currently available methods to predict RICT are suboptimal. We
investigated circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) as potential biomarkers of RICT in 
patients undergoing definitive RT for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Data from 63 patients treated on institutional trials were analyzed.
Prognostic models of grade 3 or greater (G3 +) RICT based on pre-treatment
c-miRNA levels ('c-miRNA'), mean heart dose (MHD) and pre-existing cardiac
disease (PCD) ('clinical'), and a combination of these ('c-miRNA + clinical')
were developed. Elastic net Cox regression and full cross validation were used
for variable selection, model building, and model evaluation. Concordance
statistic (c-index) and integrated Brier score (IBS) were used to evaluate model 
performance.
RESULTS: MHD, PCD, and serum levels of 14 c-miRNA species were identified as
jointly prognostic for G3 + RICT. The 'c-miRNA and 'clinical' models yielded
similar cross-validated c-indices (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and IBSs (0.26
and 0.28, respectively). However, prognostication was not improved by combining
c-miRNA and clinical factors (c-index 0.70, IBS 0.28). The 'c-miRNA' and
'clinical' models were able to significantly stratify patients into high- and
low-risk groups of developing G3 + RICT. Chi-square testing demonstrated a
marginally significantly higher prevalence of PCD in patients with high- compared
to low-risk c-miRNA profile (p = 0.09), suggesting an association between some
c-miRNAs and PCD.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a pre-treatment c-miRNA signature prognostic for
G3 + RICT. With further development, pre- and mid-treatment c-miRNA profiling
could contribute to patient-specific dose selection and treatment adaptation.

Summary: Former uranium miners of the Wismut Company, East Germany, have been
exposed to ionizing radiation from radon decay products and therefore were at
high risk for lung cancer. Since histological types of cancer in the so called
Wismut cohort revealed an association of high radon exposure with a higher
relative frequency of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), we used comparative
proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in serum exposed
uranium miners with SqCC.
Methode: Pooled sera of exposed former uranium miners without lung disease and
pooled sera of former uranium miners with SqCC were analysed by 2-D gel
electrophoresis. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed from reproducable, significantly, at 
least 5-fold up-regulated protein spots. Proteins were identified by MASCOT
peptide mass fingerprint search. Additionally a receiver operating characteristic
curve for CYFRA 21-1 was created.
Results: The protein spots were identified as Keratin 10 (K10), Keratin 1 (K1),
complement factor H (CFH) and a haptoglobin (Hpt) fragment. The sensitivity for
CYFRA 21-1 reveals 60% at a specifity of 95 and 80% at a specifity of 80%.
Plotting the sensitivity against specifity reveals an AUC of 0.88.
Conclusion: In SqCC Keratin 10 and 1 were strongly induced. This was associated
with CYFRA 21-1, confirming the cytokeratin fragment as a tumormarker.

Current research has identified several potential biomarkers for lung cancer
diagnosis or prognosis. However, most of these biomarkers are derived from a
relatively small number of samples using algorithms at the gene level. Hence,
gene expression signatures discovered in these studies have little overlaps. In
this study, we proposed a new strategy to identify biomarkers from multiple
datasets at the pathway level. We integrated the genome-wide expression data of
lung cancer tissues from 13 published studies and applied our strategy to
identify lung cancer diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. We identified a
32-gene signature that differentiates lung adenocarcinomas from other lung cancer
subtypes. We also discovered a 43-gene signature that can predict the outcome of 
human lung cancers. We tested their performance in several independent cohorts,
which confirmed their robust prognostic and diagnostic power. Furthermore, we
showed that the proposed gene expression signatures were independent of several
traditional clinical indicators in lung cancer management. Our results suggest
that the pathway-based strategy is useful to identify transcriptomic biomarkers
from large-scale gene expression datasets that were collected from multiple
sources.

BACKGROUND: Clinically-available biomarkers to identify the fraction of patients 
with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) are lacking. High nonsynonymous tumor mutational burden (TMB), as assessed
by whole exome sequencing, correlates with improved clinical outcomes for
patients with SCLC treated with ICIs. Whether TMB as assessed by targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) is associated with improved efficacy of ICIs in
patients with SCLC is currently unknown. Here we determined whether TMB by
targeted NGS is associated with efficacy of ICIs in patients with SCLC.
METHODS: We collected clinicopathologic data from patients with relapsed or
refractory SCLC which underwent targeted NGS with TMB assessment by the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute OncoPanel platform. The relationship between TMB and
clinical outcomes after treatment with ICIs was investigated.
RESULTS: Among the 52 patients treated with ICIs, we found no significant
difference in the objective response rate (ORR) between patients with a TMB above
the 50th percentile ("TMB high") and those with a TMB at or below the 50th
percentile ("TMB low"). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median
overall survival (mOS) were significantly longer in patients with a high TMB
compared to those with a low TMB (mPFS: 3.3 versus 1.2 months, HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 
0.20-0.69], P < 0.01; mOS: 10.4 versus 2.5 months, HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.19-0.77], 
P < 0.01). The one-year PFS and OS rates improved with increasing mutational load
when TMB was divided into tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that targeted NGS, a readily available clinical 
diagnostic test, can be used to identify patients with SCLC who are most likely
to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression.
Besides their well-characterized inhibitory effects on mRNA stability and
translation, miRs can also activate gene expression. In this study, we identified
a novel noncanonical function of miR-574-5p. We found that miR-574-5p acts as an 
RNA decoy to CUG RNA-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) and antagonizes its function.
MiR-574-5p induces microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression by 
preventing CUGBP1 binding to its 3'UTR, leading to an enhanced alternative
splicing and generation of an mPGES-1 3'UTR isoform, increased mPGES-1 protein
expression, PGE2 formation, and tumor growth in vivo. miR-574-5p-induced tumor
growth in mice could be completely inhibited with the mPGES-1 inhibitor CIII.
Moreover, miR-574-5p is induced by IL-1β and is strongly overexpressed in human
nonsmall cell lung cancer where high mPGES-1 expression correlates with a low
survival rate. The discovered function of miR-574-5p as a CUGBP1 decoy opens up
new therapeutic opportunities. It might serve as a stratification marker to
select lung tumor patients who respond to the pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 
formation.-Saul, M. J., Baumann, I., Bruno, A., Emmerich, A. C., Wellstein, J.,

Pleural effusions are a common medical problem not only for pulmonologists but
also for general physicians, often needing thoracentesis for a definite
diagnosis. However, thoracentesis cannot always reveal malignant cells or
microbiological evidence.In this context, we prospectively enrolled a total of
289 patients with pleural effusions due to diverse etiologies: parapneumonic
effusion (PPE) (63), empyema (22), tuberculous pleural effusion (TBPE) (54),
malignant pleural effusion (MPE) (140), or chronic renal failure (CRF)/congestive
heart failure (CHF) (10). The MPE group consisted of lung cancer (adenocarcinoma,
n = 90; squamous cell carcinoma, n = 5; small cell carcinoma, n = 4), malignant
lymphoma (n = 17), malignant mesothelioma (n = 11), malignant melanoma (n = 3),
and metastasis from other organs (n = 10).This study demonstrated that the
pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)to adenosine deaminase (ADA) ratios differed
significantly between patients with CHF/CRF, MPE, TBPE, empyema, and PPE. We
discovered a simple method to differentiate pleural diseases based on the pleural
LDH to ADA ratio and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). A pleural LDH to ADA ratio
greater than 15.5 and a pleural CEA level of less than 5 ng/mL is indicative of
PPE or empyema rather than TBPE, MPE, or transudative pleural effusion (CRF,
CHF).This method has a sensitivity of 62.0%, a specificity of 91.0%, and an area 
under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.765 (95% confidence
interval [CI]: 0678-0.852, P < .001), odds ratio of 16.6 (95% CI: 7.28-37.8,
P < .001), a positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 6.8, and a negative LR of 0.02.

Currently, there are few studies on patients with nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma,
and the pathogenesis is still unclear. The role of DNA methylation in the
pathogenesis of cancer is gradually being recognized. The purpose of this study
was to determine the abnormal methylation genes and pathways involved in
nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Gene expression microarray data
(GSE10072, GSE43458) and gene methylation microarray data (GSE62948) were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and differentially
expressed genes were obtained through GEO2R. Next, we analyzed the function and
enrichment of the selected genes using Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were
constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database
and visualized in Cytoscape. Finally, we performed module analysis of the PPI
network using Molecular Complex Detection. And we obtained 10 hub genes by
Cytoscape Centiscape. We analyzed the independent prognostic value of each hub
gene in nonsmoking nonsmall cell lung cancer patients through Kaplan-Meier
plotter. Seven hub genes (CXCL12, CDH1, CASP3, CREB1, COL1A1, ERBB2, and ENO2)
were closely related to the overall survival time. This study provides an
effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and
prognosis of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Hub genes with prognostic
value could be selected as effective biomarkers for timely diagnosis and
prognostic of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients.

Objectives: Molecular profiling of tumours has become the mainstay of diagnostics
for metastasised solid malignancies and guides personalised treatment, especially
in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In current practice, it is often
challenging to obtain sufficient tumour material for reliable molecular analysis.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood or other bio-sources could present an alternative 
approach to obtain genetic information from the tumour. In a retrospective cohort
we analysed the added value of cfDNA analysis in pleural effusions for molecular 
profiling.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed both the supernatant and the cell pellet of 
44 pleural effusions sampled from 39 stage IV patients with KRAS (n=23) or EGFR
(n=16) mutated tumours to detect the original driver mutation as well as for EGFR
T790M resistance mutations. Patients were diagnosed with either NSCLC (n=32),
colon carcinoma (n=4), appendiceal carcinoma (n=2) or adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary (n=1). Samples collected in the context of routine clinical care were
stored at the Netherlands Cancer Institute biobank. We used droplet digital PCR
for analysis.
Results: The driver mutation could be detected in 36 of the 44 pleural effusions 
by analysis of both the supernatant (35 out of 44 positive) and the cell pellet
(31 out of 44 positive). In seven out of 20 pleural effusions from patients with 
EGFR mutation-positive tumours, a T790M mutation was detected. All seven
supernatants and cell pellets were positive.
Conclusions: cfDNA in pleural effusion can be used to detect driver mutations as 
well as resistance mechanisms like EGFR T790M in pleural effusion with high
accuracy and is therefore a valuable bio-source.

BACKGROUND: Increased activity of the chaperones Hsp70 and Hsp90 is a common
feature of solid tumours. Translocase of the outer mitochondrial membrane 34
(Tomm34) is a cochaperone of both Hsp70 and Hsp90 that was found to be
overexpressed in colorectal, hepatocellular, lung and breast carcinomas. The
expression profile of Tomm34 in ovarian cancer has not been investigated.
Therefore, the aim of the current study was to investigate the expression pattern
of Tomm34 in ovarian carcinomas and analyse its correlation with
clinico-pathological parameters.
RESULTS: Epithelial ovarian cancers (140) were histologically classified based on
their morphology and graded into two types comprising 5 histologic subgroups.
Type I carcinomas comprise low grade serous (LGSC), clear cell (CCOC) and
endometrioid (ENOC), type II comprises high grade serous carcinomas (HGSC) and
solid, pseudoendometrioid, transitional carcinomas (SET). Tomm34 was more highly 
expressed in type II than type I carcinomas (p < 0.0001). Comparing tumours based
on the mutation in the TP53 gene revealed similar results, where mutant tumours
exhibited significantly higher levels of Tomm34 (p < 0.0001). The decreased
levels of Tomm34 in type I carcinomas were particularly evident in clear cell and
mucinous carcinomas. The expression of Tomm34 was also positively correlated with
FIGO stage (r = 0.23; p = 0.007). Tomm34 levels also indicated poor prognosis for
patients with mutant p53.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that Tomm34 is commonly expressed at high levels
in epithelial ovarian cancers, except for the clear cell and mucinous subtypes.
The expression of Tomm34 corresponds with the dualistic model of ovarian cancer
pathogenesis where high grade, type II tumours exhibit higher expression of
Tomm34 in contrast to type I tumours. These data are also comparable to the
previous findings that Tomm34 is a marker of progression and poor prognosis in
human cancer.

BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has considerably
expanded the armamentarium against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
contributing to reshaping treatment paradigms in the advanced disease setting.
While promising tissue- and plasma-based biomarkers are under investigation, no
reliable predictive factor is currently available to aid in treatment selection.
METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC receiving nivolumab at Sant'Andrea
Hospital and Regina Elena National Cancer Institute from June 2016 to July 2017
were enrolled onto this study. Major clinicopathological parameters were
retrieved and correlated with patients' survival outcomes in order to assess
their prognostic value and build a useful tool to assist in the decision making
process.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. The median age was 
69 years (range 44-85 years), 69 (68%) were male and 52% had ECOG PS 0.
Loco-regional/distant lymph nodes were the most commonly involved site of
metastasis (71%), followed by lung parenchyma (67%) and bone (26%). Overall
survival (OS) in the whole patients' population was 83.6%, 63.2% and 46.9% at 3, 
6 and 12 months, respectively; while progression-free survival (PFS) was 66.5%,
44.4% and 26.4% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. At univariate analysis,
age ≥ 69 years (P = 0.057), ECOG PS (P < 0.001), the presence of liver
(P < 0.001), lung (P = 0.017) metastases, lymph nodes only involvement
(P = 0.0145) were significantly associated with OS and ECOG PS (P < 0.001) and
liver metastases (P < 0.001), retained statistical significance at multivariate
analysis. A prognostic nomogram based on three variables (liver and lung
metastases and ECOG PS) was built to assign survival probability at 3, 6, and
12 months after nivolumab treatment commencement.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram based on easily available and inexpensive
clinical factors showing a good performance in predicting individual OS
probability among NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. This prognostic device
could be valuable to clinicians in more accurately driving treatment decision in 
daily practice as well as enrollment onto clinical trials.

Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, mainly due to its
late diagnoses. The detection of molecular markers on samples provided from
routine bronchoscopy including several liquid-based cytology tests (e.g.,
bronchoaspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or on easily obtained specimens such
as sputum could represent a new approach to improve the sensitivity in lung
cancer diagnoses. Recently growing interest has been reported for "noninvasive"
liquid biopsy as a valuable source for molecular profiling. Unfortunately, a
biomarker and/or composition of biomarkers capable of detecting early-stage lung 
cancer has yet to be discovered even if in the last few years there has been,
through the use of revolutionary new technologies, an explosion of lung cancer
biomarkers. Assay sensitivity and specificity need to be improved particularly
when new approaches and/or tools are used. We have focused on the most important 
markers detected in tissue, and on several cytological specimens and liquid
biopsies overall.

Objective: To explore the correlation between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of small cell lung
cancer (SCLC). Methods: The clinicopathological data of 64 patients with small
cell lung cancer from January 2013 to December 2016 in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The
correlation between PD-L1 expression and the clinicopathological features and
prognosis of SCLC was analyzed. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed
that PD-L1 expression was observed in 60.9% (39/64) of patients with small cell
lung cancer. PD-L1 expression was significantly related to stages (P<0.001).
Univariate analysis showed that the median overall survival of PD-L1 negative
group was longer than PD-L1 positive group (16 months vs 14 months, P<0.001).
Median progression-free survival of PD-L1 negative group was longer than PD-L1
positive group(15 months vs 9 months, P<0.000 1). In multivariate analysis, PD-L1
positive was significantly correlated with inferior progression-free survival
(P=0.006). Conclusions: PD-L1 expression rate was high in small cell lung cancer.
PD-L1 expression was an independent predictor for poor prognosis of patients with
small cell lung cancer.

Publisher: 目的： 探讨程序性死亡分子配体1(PD－L1)的表达与小细胞肺癌(SCLC)患者临床病理特征和预后的关系。 方法：
回顾性分析郑州大学第一附属医院2013年1月至2016年12月收治的64例SCLC患者的临床病理资料，分析PD－L1表达与SCLC患者临床病理特征和预后的关系。 
结果：
免疫组化检测结果显示，PD－L1在SCLC患者中的阳性表达率为60.9%(39/64)。PD－L1在SCLC中的表达与分期有关(P<0.001)。单因素分析结果显
示，PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位总生存时间为16个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(14个月，P<0.001)。PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位无进展生存时间为1
5个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(9个月，P<0.000
1)。多因素分析结果显示，PD－L1的阳性表达是影响SCLC患者无进展生存时间的独立危险因素(P＝0.006)。 结论：
PD－L1在SCLC患者中高表达，PD－L1阳性表达是SCLC的独立不良预后因素。.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly refractory to therapy and associated with poor
clinical outcome. Here, we reveal a critical function of the promitotic and
adhesion-mediating discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) in modulating GBM therapy
resistance. In GBM cultures and clinical samples, we show a DDR1 and GBM stem
cell marker co-expression that correlates with patient outcome. We demonstrate
that inhibition of DDR1 in combination with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide
in GBM models enhances sensitivity and prolongs survival superior to conventional
therapy. We identify a 14-3-3-Beclin-1-Akt1 protein complex assembling with DDR1 
to be required for prosurvival Akt and mTOR signaling and regulation of
autophagy-associated therapy sensitivity. Our results uncover a mechanism driven 
by DDR1 that controls GBM therapy resistance and provide a rationale target for
the development of therapy-sensitizing agents.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer morbidity and mortality in the U.S.
and racial/ethnic minorities carry the greatest burden of lung cancer disparities
with African Americans (AAs) impacted disproportionately. Inequities in lung
cancer health disparities are often associated with multiple bio-behavioral and
socio-cultural factors among racial/ethnic minorities. Epigenetic research has
advanced the understanding of the intersectionality between biological and
socio-cultural factors in lung cancer disparities among AAs. However, gaps exist 
in the engagement of diverse populations in epigenetic lung cancer research,
which poses a challenge in ensuring the generalizability and implementation of
epigenetic research in populations that carry an unequal cancer burden. Grounding
epigenetic lung cancer research within a socio-ecological framework may prove
promising in implementing a multi-level approach to community engagement,
screening, navigation, and research participation among AAs. The University of
Illinois Cancer Center (UI Cancer Center) is employing an evidence-based (EB)
model of community/patient engagement utilizing the socio-ecological model (SEM) 
to develop a culturally sensitive epigenetic lung cancer research program that
addresses multiple factors that impact lung cancer outcomes in AAs. By
implementing epigenetic research within a group of Federally Qualified Health
Centers (FQHCs) guided by the SEM, the UI Cancer Center is proposing a new
pathway in mitigating lung cancer disparities in underserved communities. At the 
individual level, the framework examines tobacco use among patients at FQHCs (the
organizational level) and also tailors epigenetic research to explore innovative 
biomarkers in high risk populations. Interpersonal interventions use Patient
Navigators to support navigation to EB tobacco cessation resources and lung
cancer screening. Community level support within the SEM is developed by ongoing 
partnerships with local and national partners such as the American Lung
Association (ALA) and the American Cancer Society (ACS). Lastly, at the policy
level, the UI Cancer Center acknowledges the role of policy implications in lung 
cancer screening and advocates for policies and screening recommendations that
examine the current guidelines from the United States Preventive Services Task
Force (USPTF).

Cryptotanshinone (CTS) was reported to repress a variety of systemic inflammation
and alleviate cardiac fibrosis, but it is still unclear whether CTS could prevent
radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Here, we investigated the effects and
underlying mechanisms of CTS on a RILI rat model. Our data revealed that CTS
could efficiently preserve pulmonary function in RILI rats and reduce early
pulmonary inflammation infiltration elicited, along with marked decreased levels 
of IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, we found that CTS is superior to prednisone in
attenuating collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis, in parallel with a marked
drop of HYP (a collagen indicator) and α-SMA (a myofibroblast marker).
Mechanistically, CTS inhibited profibrotic signals TGF-β1 and NOX-4 expressions, 
while enhancing the levels of antifibrotic enzyme MMP-1 in lung tissues. It is
noteworthy that CTS treatment, in consistent with trichrome staining analysis,
exhibited a clear advantage over PND in enhancing MMP-1 levels. However, CTS
exhibited little effect on CTGF activation and on COX-2 suppression. Finally, CTS
treatment significantly mitigated the radiation-induced activation of CCL3 and
its receptor CCR1. In summary, CTS treatment could attenuate RILI, especially
pulmonary fibrosis, in rats. The regulation on production and release of
inflammatory or fibrotic factors IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β1, NOX-4, and MMP-1,
especially MMP-1 and inhibition on CCL3/CCR1 activation, may partly attribute to 
its attenuating RILI effect.

The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung cancer have not yet been explored
systematically at the genome scale despite their important regulatory functions. 
Here, we report an integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA sequencing data for 
tumor and matched normal samples from 109 Korean female patients with
non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma. We produced miRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data for 48
patients and RNA-Seq data for 61 additional patients. Subsequent differential
expression analysis with stringent criteria yielded 44 miRNAs and 2,322 genes.
Integrative gene set analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and genes
using miRNA-target information revealed several regulatory processes related to
the cell cycle that were targeted by tumor suppressor miRNAs. We performed colony
formation assays in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines to test the tumor suppressive
activity of down-regulated miRNAs in cancer and identified 7 novel tumor
suppressor miRNAs (miR-144-5p, miR-218-1-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-30a-3p, 
miR-30c-2-3p, miR-338-5p). Two miRNAs, miR-30a-3p and miR-30c-2-3p, showed
differential survival characteristics in the TCGA LUAD patient cohort indicating 
their prognostic value. Finally, we identified a network cluster of miRNAs and
target genes that could be responsible for cell cycle regulation. Our study not
only provides a dataset of miRNA as well as mRNA sequencing from the matched
tumor-normal samples, but also reports several novel tumor suppressor miRNAs that
could potentially be developed into prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic RNA
drugs.

Update of
    Cochrane Database Syst Rev. 2012 Dec 12;12:CD004705.

BACKGROUND: A possible strategy for increasing smoking cessation rates could be
to provide smokers with feedback on the current or potential future biomedical
effects of smoking using, for example, measurement of exhaled carbon monoxide
(CO), lung function, or genetic susceptibility to lung cancer or other diseases.
OBJECTIVES: The main objective was to determine the efficacy of providing smokers
with feedback on their exhaled CO measurement, spirometry results,
atherosclerotic plaque imaging, and genetic susceptibility to smoking-related
diseases in helping them to quit smoking.
SEARCH METHODS: For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco
Addiction Group Specialized Register in March 2018 and ClinicalTrials.gov and the
WHO ICTRP in September 2018 for studies added since the last update in 2012.
SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria for the review were: a randomised
controlled trial design; participants being current smokers; interventions based 
on a biomedical test to increase smoking cessation rates; control groups
receiving all other components of intervention; and an outcome of smoking
cessation rate at least six months after the start of the intervention.
DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures expected
by Cochrane. We expressed results as a risk ratio (RR) for smoking cessation with
95% confidence intervals (CI). Where appropriate, we pooled studies using a
Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method.
MAIN RESULTS: We included 20 trials using a variety of biomedical tests
interventions; one trial included two interventions, for a total of 21
interventions. We included a total of 9262 participants, all of whom were adult
smokers. All studies included both men and women adult smokers at different
stages of change and motivation for smoking cessation. We judged all but three
studies to be at high or unclear risk of bias in at least one domain. We pooled
trials in three categories according to the type of biofeedback provided:
feedback on risk exposure (five studies); feedback on smoking-related disease
risk (five studies); and feedback on smoking-related harm (11 studies). There was
no evidence of increased cessation rates from feedback on risk exposure,
consisting mainly of feedback on CO measurement, in five pooled trials (RR 1.00, 
95% CI 0.83 to 1.21; I2 = 0%; n = 2368). Feedback on smoking-related disease
risk, including four studies testing feedback on genetic markers for cancer risk 
and one study with feedback on genetic markers for risk of Crohn's disease, did
not show a benefit in smoking cessation (RR 0.80, 95% CI 0.63 to 1.01; I2 = 0%; n
= 2064). Feedback on smoking-related harm, including nine studies testing
spirometry with or without feedback on lung age and two studies on feedback on
carotid ultrasound, also did not show a benefit (RR 1.26, 95% CI 0.99 to 1.61; I2
= 34%; n = 3314). Only one study directly compared multiple forms of measurement 
with a single form of measurement, and did not detect a significant difference in
effect between measurement of CO plus genetic susceptibility to lung cancer and
measurement of CO only (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.43 to 1.56; n = 189).
AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is little evidence about the effects of biomedical
risk assessment as an aid for smoking cessation. The most promising results
relate to spirometry and carotid ultrasound, where moderate-certainty evidence,
limited by imprecision and risk of bias, did not detect a statistically
significant benefit, but confidence intervals very narrowly missed one, and the
point estimate favoured the intervention. A sensitivity analysis removing those
studies at high risk of bias did detect a benefit. Moderate-certainty evidence
limited by risk of bias did not detect an effect of feedback on smoking exposure 
by CO monitoring. Low-certainty evidence, limited by risk of bias and
imprecision, did not detect a benefit from feedback on smoking-related risk by
genetic marker testing. There is insufficient evidence with which to evaluate the
hypothesis that multiple types of assessment are more effective than single forms
of assessment.

Antibodies that target programmed death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) have become a mainstay of first-line treatment of
advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable genetic
alterations. In this review, we summarize results from recent clinical trials
that have evaluated the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the 
anti-PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab as first-line treatment as
monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, other immunotherapies, and
anti-angiogenesis agents. We discuss factors that may influence treatment
selection, including patient baseline clinical and demographic characteristics,
tumor histology, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation
burden. While immunotherapy has become a central component of first-line
treatment for most patients with advanced NSCLC, important questions remain about
how treatment should be managed for individual patients.

Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1) plays a significant
role in cell proliferation and development. Its regulation in humans is very
critical and incompletely understood in Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: 100 newly diagnosed NSCLC (lung adenocarcinoma) patients and 100 healthy
controls were included and allele specific (AS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to genotype and expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR.
Overall survival of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and for
prognostic significance ROC curve was plotted. Results: A statistically
significant difference (p<0.0001) in CC, AA and CA genotypes distribution among
patients and healthy controls was observed. Compared to the CC genotype as
reference, OR was 30.40 (95%CI 1.75- 524.9, p=0.0002) and 3.97 (95%CI 1.49-10.52,
p=0.003) for the homozygous AA and heterozygous CA genotypes respectively.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed to analyze the relationship of 
EGFR1 (-191C/A) genotypes with progression free median survival of NSCLC patients
and the difference was found to be significantly (p=0.0002) associated with
different genotypes. In the ROC curve with respect to TNM stage at optimal
cut-off value of 9.88 fold increase in EGFR1 mRNA expression, sensitivity and
specificity were 92.9%, 83.3% respectively (AUC=0.95, p<0.0001). ROC curve w.r.t.
distant metastases at optimal cut-off value of 13.5 fold change EGFR1 mRNA
expression, sensitivity and specificity were 68.2%, 71.4% respectively (AUC=0.81,
p<0.0001). In ROC curve w.r.t to presence/ absence of pleural effusion at optimal
cut-off value of 14.8 fold change EGFR1 mRNA expression sensitivity and
specificity were 66.7%, 68.2% respectively (AUC=0.71, p=0.009). Conclusions:
Study concluded EGFR1 promoter polymorphism could be a risk factor associated
with disease and may be used as prognostic marker for patients’ survival and
predictor for disease worseness.

Medical Sciences of China Medical University, 110001, Shenyang, China.

Hes3 is a basic helix-loop-helix factor gene, which was found to be involved in
neural cell differentiation. Expression and clinicopathological significance of
Hes3 in non-small cell lung cancer was not clear. In this study, we used
immunohistochemistry to examine Hes3 expression in normal human lung and
non-small cell lung cancer tissues. Hes3 expression was detected in cytoplasm and
nucleus. Hes3 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and epithelial cells of
submucosal glands was relatively weak and the positive rate was of 30.3% (10/33).
Hes3 expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues (51.8% (58/112)) was
significantly higher than that in normal lung tissues (p < 0.05). Hes3 expression
in cancer tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation,
advanced TNM stages, lymph node metastasis, and a shorter patient survival time
(p < 0.05). In vitro study showed that overexpression of Hes3 in A549 cells
significantly promoted cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while inhibition
of Hes3 expression significantly downregulated cancer cell proliferation and
invasion (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that overexpression of Hes3
significantly upregulated expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7 in A549
cells, while inhibition of Hes3 expression in LK2 cells significantly
downregulated the expression of these molecules (p < 0.05). These results
indicated that Hes3 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of non-small cell
lung cancer, possibly through regulation of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7, and
may be a promising cancer marker.

Comparatively less toxic and more tolerated, epidermal growth factor
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are recommendable for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations. Some
EGFR wild-type patients with specific biomarkers also show a response to the
drug. TAZ is an oncogene closely associated with the therapeutic effect of
EGFR-TKIs. However, this association remains to be clarified. This study aimed to
clarify the mechanism through which TAZ sensitizes EGFR wild-type NSCLC to
gefitinib. We used CCK-8 assays and in vivo experiments to investigate the
influence of TAZ on gefitinib in EGFR wild-type NSCLC. To further validate the
tumorigenic role of TAZ, we performed Human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC) tube formation and migration assays. Luciferase reporter assays,
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting and Chromatin
immunoprecipitation collaborated with qPCR illuminated the mechanism through
which TAZ caused those phenotypes. The results showed TAZ promoted the
angiogenesis of NSCLC cell lines and improved gefitinib sensitivity in EGFR
wild-type NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assays and ChIP-qPCR
experiments showed TAZ upregulated AREG by promoting its transcription. EGFR
signaling pathway was activated as TAZ was highly expressed. Rescue experiments
were conducted to confirm the indispensable role of AREG in tumorigenesis and
gefitinib sensitivity regulated by TAZ. Our study concluded that TAZ sensitized
EGFR wild-type NSCLC to gefitinib through promoting amphiregulin transcription.

BACKGROUND: Stathmin-1regulates microtubule dynamics and is associated with
malignant phenotypes in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluated 
its diagnostic value for differentiating between NSCLC and high-grade
neuroendocrine tumor (HGNET).
METHODS: Stathmin-1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
in surgical specimens of 414 NSCLC (305 adenocarcinoma [AD], 102 squamous cell
carcinoma [SCC], 7 large-cell carcinoma [LA]), 5 typical carcinoid (TC; a
low-grade neuroendocrine tumor), and 34 HGNET (17 small-cell carcinoma [SCLC] and
17 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [LCNEC]) and biopsy specimens of 57 NSCLCs
(29 AD and 28 SCC) and 42 HGNETs (17 LCNEC and 25 SCLC). We also analyzed
stathmin-1 mRNA levels in 81 NSCLC and 26 HGNET using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Among NSCLC samples, we saw high stathmin-1 protein expression in only 3
AD, 1 SCC and 1 LA surgical samples, all 5 of which showed neuroendocrine
characteristics in pathological re-review; and low or intermediate expression in 
all 5 TC surgical samples and all 57 NSCLC biopsy samples. In contrast, all HGNET
surgical (n=34) and biopsy (n=42) samples showed highstathmin-1 expression. In
RT-PCR, stathmin-1expression was significantly higher in HGNET tissues than in
NSCLC tissues (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Stathmin-1 expression can help in differentiating NSCLC from HGNET.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
Eastern Asia. The prognosis of LC highly depends on tumor stages and early
detection could substantially reduce LC mortality. Accumulating evidence
suggested that circulating miRNAs in plasma or serum may have applications in
early LC detection. We thus conducted a systematic literature review on the
diagnostic value of miRNAs markers for LC in East Asian populations.
METHODS: PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to retrieve relevant
articles published up to 17 September 2018. Information on study design,
population characteristics, investigated miRNAs and diagnostic accuracy
(including sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC)) were
independently extracted by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Overall, 46 studies that evaluated a total of 88 miRNA markers for LC
diagnosis in East Asian populations were identified. Sixteen of the 46 studies
have incorporated individual miRNA markers as panels (with 2⁻20 markers). Three
promising miRNA panels with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥90% specificity were
discovered, two of which were externally validated. Diagnostic performance of
circulating miRNAs in East Asian populations was comparable to previously
summarized performance in Western populations. Forty-four miRNAs were reported in
both populations. No major differences in diagnostic performance by ethnicity of 
the same miRNA was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miRNAs or miRNA panels, possibly in combination with
other promising molecular markers including epigenetic and genetic markers, may
be promising candidates for noninvasive LC early detection. However, large

Reports on the use of cryobiopsy (CB) for lung cancer diagnosis are limited. The 
aims of the present study were to evaluate the safety and usefulness of CB using 
radial endobronchial ultrasonography, without a guide sheath, for the diagnosis
of peripheral pulmonary lesions and determine the utility of stamp cytology, an
on-site diagnostic technique for determining tumor inclusion in CB samples. We
retrospectively analyzed data for 35 patients (36 lesions) with suspected
peripheral lung cancer who underwent CB between August 2017 and February 2019 at 
our medical facility. The diagnostic yield, incidence of complications, and the
utility of stamp cytology for diagnosis were investigated. The diagnostic yield
of CB was 86.1% (31/36) with histological diagnosis, and 80.5% (29/36) with
diagnosis using stamp cytology; the overall yield was 91.6% (33/36). Pneumothorax
requiring thoracic drainage occurred in two patients, both of whom had lesions
contacting the pleura. Grade 2 and grade 1 bleeding occurred in one and 25
patients, respectively. CB enables the collection of very large, nearly intact
tissue samples, thus resulting in an improvement in the true diagnosis rate and
facilitating the measurement of multiple biomarkers as well as rapid histological
diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the major causes of carcinoma-related deaths in
the world. Importantly, lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the most common type with
poor outcome. However, the progressive clinical phenotype and biomolecular
signature of lung cancer presenting the cancer stem-like and metastatic
characteristics are still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we identified CD44 marker in lung cancers. The
capabilities, including tumorigenic and migration assays, were analyzed in CD44
expression and CD44 expression subgroups. Meanwhile, the potential bio-signature 
and properties of lung tumor stem-like cells were further studied.
RESULTS: The high expression of CD44 subpopulation (CD44-positive) in isolated
lung cancer cells showed significantly higher abilities of tumorigenic colonies, 
tumor-sphere formation, and migratory properties when compared with the CD44
expression group. These subgroups of CD44-positive lung cancer cells further
demonstrated the metastatic potential with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), as well as the high expression of Twist and Snail gene profile.
Importantly, the overexpression of Snail with gene vector in CD44 expression
cells further significantly promoted the properties of lung tumor stem-like
cells.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlighted the role of CD44-posivite
subpopulation in modulating tumor initiation and EMT-based metastatic ability of 
lung malignancy.

High mortality rates caused by NSCLC show the need for the identification of
novel therapeutic targets. In this study we have investigated the biological
effects and molecular mechanisms elicited by TMPRSS4 in NSCLC. Overexpression of 
TMPRSS4 in LKR13 cells increased malignancy, subcutaneous tumor growth and
multiorganic metastasis. In conditional knock-down (KD) experiments, abrogation
of TMPRSS4 in H358 and H2170 cells altered proliferation, clonogenicity, tumor
engraftment and tumor growth. Reduction in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
decreased BrdU incorporation and increased apoptosis was also found.
Transcriptomic analysis in KD cells revealed downregulation of genes involved in 
DNA replication, such as MCM6, TYMS and CDKN1A (p21). In patients, expression of 
a signature of MCM6/TYMS/TMPRSS4 genes was highly associated with poor prognosis.
Downregulation of TMPRSS4 significantly increased sensitivity to chemotherapy
agents. In experiments using cisplatin, apoptosis and expression of the
DNA-damage marker γ-H2A was higher in cells lacking TMPRSS4. Moreover, in vivo
assays demonstrated that tumors with no TMPRSS4 were significantly more sensitive
to cisplatin than controls. These results show that TMPRSS4 can be considered as 
a novel target in NSCLC, whose inhibition increases chemosensitivity.

CA199 is a sialic acid containing glycan antigen found in both glycoproteins and 
glycolipids, which is recognized by monoclonal antibodies generated by hybridoma 
technology. The increased serum CA199 levels measured by using the monoclonal
antibodies have been used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for pancreatic
cancer. Even though increased serum CA199 levels are also observed in other
cancers and noncancer diseases, it is largely unknown if CA199 levels could serve
as biomarkers for other diseases as well. Therefore, in our current study, serum 
CA199 levels from 45,645 patients with 47 clinically defined diseases and 14,783 
healthy controls who attended their annual physical examination were collected
and measured by the clinical laboratory in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao
University over the past 5 years. Based on the median, mean, and -Log10p values, 
we found that patients with pancreatic cancer, lung fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver
cancer, hepatitis, and pancreatitis had the highest media and mean serum CA199
levels with statistical significance based on the -Log10p values. Unexpectedly,
patients suffering from gout and anemia had significantly low CA199 levels
compared to that of the healthy controls. These results showed that serum CA199
levels are not only increased in pancreatic and other cancer patients but also
either increased or decreased in noncancer diseases. The overall data indicated
that the abnormal serum CA199 level might be an indicator of system malfunction
rather than a cancer biomarker in general.

Carbohydrate antigen 50 (CA50) is initially reported as a cancer-specific antigen
expressed on the surface of human colorectal Colo-205 cancer cells. Subsequently,
increased serum CA50 levels are observed in patients not only with colorectal
cancers but also other types of cancers. Eventually, serum CA50 is measured
clinically as a cancer biomarker. However, serum CA50 level does not always
increase in cancer patients but does increase in patients suffering from
nonneoplasm diseases, which indicates that serum CA50 is not produced by cancer
cells exclusively. Therefore, the serum CA50 levels in patients suffering
different types of diseases should be systematically compared in order to
comprehend the molecular nature of serum CA50 as a biomarker. In our current
study, we measured and analyzed serum CA50 levels from 2113 patients with 14
clinically defined diseases with at least 30 independent tests for each disease
in addition to 13,997 serum samples from individuals who attend their annual
physical examination as healthy controls. Based on the mean, median, and -Log10p 
values, we found that patients suffering from pancreatic cancer, cirrhosis,
pancreatitis, lung cancer, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and colon cancer had highest
levels of serum CA50 while patients suffering from coronary heart disease,
gastric cancer, and rectum cancer showed comparable serum CA50 levels to that of 
healthy controls. Moreover, patients with osteoporosis, anemia, or gastritis had 
lower serum CA50 levels than that of healthy controls. Furthermore, healthy
individuals older than 65 years old had increased serum CA50 levels compared with
that of healthy controls. Taken together, these data suggest that serum CA50 is
likely to be a system malfunction biomarker, and the serum CA50 levels could be
used as diagnostic biomarkers not only for cancers but also for other nonneoplasm
diseases.

Increased serum squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCCA) levels are clinically used
diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for squamous cell carcinomas. According to
recently published studies, increased serum SCCA levels are also observed in
adenocarcinomas, hepatocarcinomas, kidney, and other inflammatory diseases,
indicating squamous cell carcinoma is not the production source of serum SCCA in 
these diseases. However, serum SCCA levels in patients suffering different types 
of diseases have not been systematically measured and compared. Thus, in our
current study, serum SCCA levels from 21,608 patients with 39 clinically defined 
diseases were collected and measured by the clinical laboratory in the Affiliated
Hospital of Qingdao University over the past 5 years in addition to 232 serum
samples from individuals who attend their annual physical examination as the
healthy controls. According to the median, mean, and -log10p values, we found
that patients with uremia, azotemia, diabetic nephropathy, and nephritic syndrome
had the highest serum SCCA levels among all 39 different types of diseases
including patients suffering squamous cell carcinomas. Moreover, patients
suffering lung cancer, cervical cancer, esophagus cancer, or chronic pulmonary
disease had lower median and interquartile range values but higher or comparable 
mean values and significantly higher SD values than that of the healthy controls.
Furthermore, patients with endometrial cancer, pancreatitis, osteoporosis, and
some other diseases had lower serum SCCA levels than that of the healthy
controls. These results demonstrated that serum SCCA can not only be used in
diagnosis and prognosis of squamous cell carcinomas but also as biomarkers for
uremia, azotemia, diabetic nephropathy, and nephritic syndrome.

Most of clinically used cancer biomarkers are either specific glycan structures
or glycoproteins. Although the high serum levels of the cancer biomarkers are
also present in certain patients suffering noncancer diseases, systematic
measurement and comparison of the serum levels of all cancer biomarkers among
cancer and noncancer patients have not been reported. In this study, the serum
levels of 17 glucose and glycan-related biomarkers including 10 cancer biomarkers
SCCA, CA724, CA50, CA242, CA125, CA199, CA153, AFP, CEA, and PSA were
retrospectively investigated based on clinical laboratory data in two medical
centers during the past 6 years (2012-2018). The data included a total of
1,477,309 clinical lab test results of 17 biomarkers from healthy controls and
patients suffering 64 different types of cancer and noncancer diseases. We found 
that the median serum levels of CA724, CEA, CA153, SCCA, and CA125 were highest
not in cancer patients but in patients suffering gout, lung fibrosis, nephrotic
syndrome, uremia, and cirrhosis, respectively. Consistently, the classical
ovarian cancer biomarker CA125 had better overall sensitivity and specificity as 
biomarker for cirrhosis (67% and 92%, respectively) than that for ovarian cancer 
(41% and 97%, respectively). Furthermore, the information shown as heatmap or
waterfall built on the -Log10p values of the 17 glycan-related biomarkers in
different clinically defined diseases suggested that all glycan-related
biomarkers had cancer-, aging-, and disease-relevant characteristics and cancers 
were systems disease. The detailed presentation of the data for each of the 17
biomarkers will be deliberated in chapters 6-23 in this book series.

Wide use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as white pigments induces
unintentionally release in environment which increases concerns about their
adverse health effects on respiratory system. So it is crucial to get a deep
understanding of the disease process and molecular mechanism. Epigenetic
mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have been found to play a role in the
development of lung diseases by affecting expression of key genes. In addition,
there could be potential different toxic effects of TiO2 NPs between young and
adult. Thus, the comparative toxicity of TiO2 NPs in 5-week (young) and 10-week
(adult) old NIH mice is investigated in this study following nasal inhalation of 
TiO2 NPs at dose of 20 mg/kg (body weight)/day for 30 days. Global DNA
methylation and hydroxymethylation in lung were measured. Promoter methylation of
inflammatory genes (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and tissue fibrosis gene (Thy-1) were
determined. Additional, RNA-sequencing runs were performed on the pulmonic
libraries. We found the induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were more
severe in young mice. Decreased global methylation and hydroxymethylation were
only found in the young group. The altered methylation in promoter of TNF-α and
Thy-1 were found to play a role in the inflammatory response and fibration.
RNA-sequencing showed that in pathways in cancer expression of 197 genes was
up-regulated in the young mice more that in the adult mice. All these results
suggested that the young ages are more sensitive to TiO2 NP exposure and the
potential of abnormal DNA methylation might be used as biomarkers of both
exposure and disease development.

The establishment of novel biomarkers in liquid biopsies of cancer patients comes
more into focus of prognostic and diagnostic research efforts. Due to their
prognostic relevance disseminated tumor cells or circulating tumor cells are the 
subject of intensive research, and are discussed as early diagnostic indicators
for treatment failure and the formation of micrometastases. A potential
association of this early-systemic tumor component with poor prognosis of cancer 
patients could be already demonstrated for various entities including breast,
colon, lung, melanoma, ovarian, and prostate cancers. Thus, the detection of
circulating tumor cells seems to be also applicable for minimal-invasive
monitoring of therapy progress in head and neck cancer patients. A major problem 
of the use in clinical routine is that circulating tumor cells could not be
detected by modern imaging techniques. To overcome these limitations highly
sensitive detections methods and techniques for their molecular characterization 
are urgently needed allowing mechanistic understanding and targeting of
circulating tumor cells. Especially the medical application of nanotechnology
(nanomedical methods) has made valuable contributions to the field. Here, we want
to provide a comprehensive overview on (nanomedical) detection methods for
circulating tumor cells and discuss their merits, pitfalls and future
perspectives especially for HNSCC patients.

INTRODUCTION: Neuroendocrine tumors of the lung (Lung-NETs) make up a
heterogenous family of neoplasms showing neuroendocrine differentiation and
encompass carcinoids and neuroendocrine carcinomas. On molecular grounds, they
considered two completely distinct and separate tumor groups with no overlap of
molecular alterations nor common developmental mechanisms. Areas covered: Two
perspectives were evaluated based on an extensive review and rethinking of
literature: (1) the current classification as an instrument to obtaining clinical
and molecular insights into the context of Lung-NETs; and (2) an alternative and 
innovative interpretation of these tumors, proposing a tripartite separation into
early aggressive primary high-grade neuroendocrine tumors (HGNET),
differentiating or secondary HGNET, and indolent NET. Expert opinion: We herein
provide an alternative outlook on Lung-NETs, which is a paradigm shift to current
pathogenesis models and expands the understanding of these tumors.

Melanoma of the skin is the sixth most common type of cancer in Europe and
accounts for 3.4% of all diagnosed cancers. More alarming is the degree of
recurrence that occurs with approximately 20% of patients lethally relapsing
following treatment. Malignant melanoma is a highly aggressive skin cancer and
metastases rapidly extend to the regional lymph nodes (stage 3) and to distal
organs (stage 4). Targeted oncotherapy is one of the standard treatment for
progressive stage 4 melanoma, and BRAF inhibitors (e.g. vemurafenib, dabrafenib) 
combined with MEK inhibitor (e.g. trametinib) can effectively counter
BRAFV600E-mutated melanomas. Compared to conventional chemotherapy, targeted
BRAFV600E inhibition achieves a significantly higher response rate. After a
period of cancer control, however, most responsive patients develop resistance to
the therapy and lethal progression. The many underlying factors potentially
causing resistance to BRAF inhibitors have been extensively studied.
Nevertheless, the remaining unsolved clinical questions necessitate alternative
research approaches to address the molecular mechanisms underlying metastatic and
treatment-resistant melanoma. In broader terms, proteomics can address clinical
questions far beyond the reach of genomics, by measuring, i.e. the relative
abundance of protein products, post-translational modifications (PTMs), protein
localisation, turnover, protein interactions and protein function. More
specifically, proteomic analysis of body fluids and tissues in a given medical
and clinical setting can aid in the identification of cancer biomarkers and novel
therapeutic targets. Achieving this goal requires the development of a robust and
reproducible clinical proteomic platform that encompasses automated biobanking of
patient samples, tissue sectioning and histological examination, efficient
protein extraction, enzymatic digestion, mass spectrometry-based quantitative
protein analysis by label-free or labelling technologies and/or enrichment of
peptides with specific PTMs. By combining data from, e.g. phosphoproteomics and
acetylomics, the protein expression profiles of different melanoma stages can
provide a solid framework for understanding the biology and progression of the
disease. When complemented by proteogenomics, customised protein sequence
databases generated from patient-specific genomic and transcriptomic data aid in 
interpreting clinical proteomic biomarker data to provide a deeper and more
comprehensive molecular characterisation of cellular functions underlying disease
progression. In parallel to a streamlined, patient-centric, clinical proteomic
pipeline, mass spectrometry-based imaging can aid in interrogating the spatial
distribution of drugs and drug metabolites within tissues at single-cell
resolution. These developments are an important advancement in studying drug
action and efficacy in vivo and will aid in the development of more effective and
safer strategies for the treatment of melanoma. A collaborative effort of
gargantuan proportions between academia and healthcare professionals has led to
the initiation, establishment and development of a cutting-edge cancer research
centre with a specialisation in melanoma and lung cancer. The primary research
focus of the European Cancer Moonshot Lund Center is to understand the impact
that drugs have on cancer at an individualised and personalised level.
Simultaneously, the centre increases awareness of the relentless battle against
cancer and attracts global interest in the exceptional research performed at the 
centre.

Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a major antioxidant enzyme in plasma, catalyzes 
the reduction of H2O2, lipid peroxides and organic hydroperoxides by reducing
glutathione (GSH). Hypermethylation of the GPx3 promoter and suppression of GPx3 
expression are associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, and response to
chemotherapy in various types of cancer. We previously reported the possibility
of GPx3 as a serological marker for lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the
role of the microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-921 (miR-921) in the regulation of GPx3
expression in A549 lung cancer cells. The expression patterns of the miRNAs of
A549, H1650, and H1975 cells were compared and analyzed. Of 25 miRNAs from the
A549 cell line, the expression of 10 decreased and the expression of 15 increased
in comparison to the miRNAs from the other cell lines. Of the miRNAs with reduced
expression, the most reduced miRNA was miR-921 and the expected binding site of
which is in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GPx3. We found that miR-921
inhibited the expression of GPx3 and bound directly to the 3'-UTR of GPx3.

infection with Cryptococcus neoformans.

Cryptococcus neoformans is a leading cause of invasive fungal infections among
immunocompromised patients. However, the cellular constituents of the innate
immune response that promote clearance versus progression of infection upon
respiratory acquisition of C. neoformans remain poorly defined. In this study, we
found that during acute C. neoformans infection, CCR2+ Ly6Chi inflammatory
monocytes (IM) rapidly infiltrate the lungs and mediate fungal trafficking to
lung-draining lymph nodes. Interestingly, this influx of IM is detrimental to the
host, since ablating IM or impairing their recruitment to the lungs improves
murine survival and reduces fungal proliferation and dissemination. Using a novel
conditional gene deletion strategy, we determined that MHC class II expression by
IM did not mediate their deleterious impact on the host. Furthermore, although
ablation of IM reduced the number of lymphocytes, innate lymphoid cells, and
eosinophils in the lungs, the effects of IM were not dependent on these cells. We
ascertained that IM in the lungs upregulated transcripts associated with
alternatively activated (M2) macrophages in response to C. neoformans, consistent
with the model that IM assume a cellular phenotype that is permissive for fungal 
growth. We also determined that conditional knockout of the prototypical M2
marker arginase 1 in IM and deletion of the M2-associated transcription factor
STAT6 were not sufficient to reverse the harmful effects of IM. Overall, our
findings indicate that C. neoformans can subvert the fungicidal potential of IM
to enable the progression of infection through a mechanism that is not dependent 
on lymphocyte priming, eosinophil recruitment, or downstream M2 macrophage
polarization pathways. These results give us new insight into the plasticity of
IM function during fungal infections and the level of control that C. neoformans 
can exert on host immune responses.

An increasing number of microRNA (miRNA) have been demonstrated to serve as
molecular biomarkers for tumor cell progression. miR‑512‑5p was revealed as
oncogenic regulator in several types of cancer. However, whether and how
miR‑512‑5p regulates non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the
present study, the expression of miR‑512‑5p was detected in NSCLC tissues and
cell lines. Then, the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in NSCLC
A549 and H1299 cell lines were detected when miR‑512‑5p was overexpressed.
Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was identified. The level of miR‑512‑5p was
decreased in NSCLC tissues and in NSCLC cells compared with adjacent normal
tissues and normal lung tissue cell lines. miR‑512‑5p mimics inhibited the cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis in A549 and H1299 cells.
In addition, a luciferase reporter assay suggested that overexpression of
miR‑512‑5p may decrease the expression of the E26 transformation
specific‑1 (ETS1) gene; it was subsequently verified that downregulation of the
ETS1 gene inhibited cell proliferation and migration and induced cell apoptosis
in A549 and H1299 cells, and ETS1 small interfering RNA in the presence of an
miR‑512‑5p inhibitor reversed the effect. The data described in the present study
suggest that miR‑512‑5p may be a tumor suppressor and a potential treatment
target in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have become a potential diagnostic
tumor marker and have the potential for wide clinical applications. However, the 
diagnostic parameters vary among previous studies. A systematic review of the
literature and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic value of
CTCs for lung cancer.
METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and
Embase databases. The included studies assessed the diagnostic value of CTCs in
patients with lung cancer up to September 30, 2018. A total of 1601 patients in 8
studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated the pooled sensitivity,
specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR),
diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) to investigate the
diagnostic value of CTCs for lung cancer. STATA version 12.0 and Meta-DiSc
version 1.4 software were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73-0.78), the specificity was
0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), the PLR was 6.29 (95% CI: 3.98-9.96), and the NLR was
0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.42). Furthermore, the pooled DOR of CTCs for lung cancer was
27.73 (95% CI: 12.99-59.23). The summarized area under the ROC curve was 0.93
(95% CI: 0.90-0.95). The meta-regression analysis suggested that the
heterogeneity was mainly attributed to the experimental methods. The results of
the clinical diagnosis efficiency show that the diagnostic efficiency has
increased significantly by testing CTCs for diagnosing lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CTCs are associated
with a high diagnostic value for lung cancer. These findings require large-scale 
prospective studies to verify and evaluate the diagnostic value in the future.

BACKGROUND: The "GENetIcs of sUbSequent Coronary Heart Disease" (GENIUS-CHD)
consortium was established to facilitate discovery and validation of genetic
variants and biomarkers for risk of subsequent CHD events, in individuals with
established CHD.
METHODS: The consortium currently includes 57 studies from 18 countries,
recruiting 185,614 participants with either acute coronary syndrome, stable CHD
or a mixture of both at baseline. All studies collected biological samples and
followed-up study participants prospectively for subsequent events.
RESULTS: Enrollment into the individual studies took place between 1985 to
present day with duration of follow up ranging from 9 months to 15 years. Within 
each study, participants with CHD are predominantly of self-reported European
descent (38%-100%), mostly male (44%-91%) with mean ages at recruitment ranging
from 40 to 75 years. Initial feasibility analyses, using a federated analysis
approach, yielded expected associations between age (HR 1.15 95% CI 1.14-1.16)
per 5-year increase, male sex (HR 1.17, 95% CI 1.13-1.21) and smoking (HR 1.43,
95% CI 1.35-1.51) with risk of subsequent CHD death or myocardial infarction, and
differing associations with other individual and composite cardiovascular
endpoints.
CONCLUSIONS: GENIUS-CHD is a global collaboration seeking to elucidate genetic
and non-genetic determinants of subsequent event risk in individuals with
established CHD, in order to improve residual risk prediction and identify novel 
drug targets for secondary prevention. Initial analyses demonstrate the
feasibility and reliability of a federated analysis approach. The consortium now 
plans to initiate and test novel hypotheses as well as supporting replication and
validation analyses for other investigators.

OBJECTIVES: Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1) is a cancer/testis
antigen reactivated in several human malignancies. So far, the major focus of
studies on KK-LC-1 has been on its potential as diagnostic biomarker and
immunotherapy target. However, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms 
in cancer progression remain unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of KK-LC-1 in HCC was analysed using RT-qPCR,
Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The roles of KK-LC-1 on HCC progression
were examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Pathway
inhibitor DAPT was employed to confirm the regulatory effect of KK-LC-1 on the
downstream Notch signalling. The interaction of KK-LC-1 with presenilin-1 was
determined by co-immunoprecipitation. The association of CpG island methylation
status with KK-LC-1 reactivation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR,
bisulphite sequencing PCR and 5-Aza-dC treatment.
RESULTS: We identified that HCC tissues exhibited increased levels of KK-LC-1.
High KK-LC-1 level independently predicted poor survival outcome. KK-LC-1
promoted cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
in vitro and in vivo. KK-LC-1 modulated the Notch1/Hes1 pathway to exacerbate HCC
progression through physically interacting with presenilin-1. Upregulation of
KK-LC-1 in HCC was attributed to hypomethylated CpG islands.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that hypomethylation-induced KK-LC-1
overexpression played an important role in HCC progression and independently
predicted poor survival. We defined the KK-LC-1/presenilin-1/Notch1/Hes1 as a
novel signalling pathway that was involved in the growth and metastasis of HCC.

INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded one of the major breakthroughs in cancer 
treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the
quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are
related to and may therefore act as non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for
immunotherapy response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic
lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We performed a AI-based characterization of 
each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and 
validate a non-invasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing
between immunotherapy responding and non-responding. To define the biological
basis of the radiographic biomarker, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis in
an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients.
RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to
0.83 AUC, p < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64
AUC, p = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level,
immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both
cancer types (p < 0.001), resulting in a one year survival difference of 24%
(p = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in
mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and 
preferential response to immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions 
on standard-of-care imaging may function as non-invasive biomarkers for response 
to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in
both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.

Histologic transformation to small cell neuroendocrine prostate cancer occurs in 
a subset of patients with advanced prostate cancer as a mechanism of treatment
resistance. Rovalpituzumab tesirine (SC16LD6.5) is an antibody-drug conjugate
that targets delta-like protein 3 (DLL3) and was initially developed for small
cell lung cancer. We found that DLL3 is expressed in most of the
castration-resistant neuroendocrine prostate cancer (CRPC-NE) (36 of 47, 76.6%)
and in a subset of castration-resistant prostate adenocarcinomas (7 of 56,
12.5%). It shows minimal to no expression in localized prostate cancer (1 of 194)
and benign prostate (0 of 103). DLL3 expression correlates with neuroendocrine
marker expression, RB1 loss, and aggressive clinical features. DLL3 in
circulating tumor cells was concordant with matched metastatic biopsy (87%).
Treatment of DLL3-expressing prostate cancer xenografts with a single dose of
SC16LD6.5 resulted in complete and durable responses, whereas DLL3-negative
models were insensitive. We highlight a patient with neuroendocrine prostate
cancer with a meaningful clinical and radiologic response to SC16LD6.5 when
treated on a phase 1 trial. Overall, our findings indicate that DLL3 is
preferentially expressed in CRPC-NE and provide rationale for targeting DLL3 in
patients with DLL3-positive metastatic prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations across
multiple cancers can reveal shared biologic pathways. Prior pleiotropic studies
have primarily focused on European-descent individuals. Yet population-specific
genetic variation can occur, and potential pleiotropic associations among diverse
racial/ethnic populations could be missed. We examined cross-cancer pleiotropic
associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans.
METHODS: We conducted a pleiotropic analysis among 1,410 African American lung
cancer cases and 2,843 controls. We examined 36,958 variants previously
associated (or in linkage disequilibrium) with cancer in prior genome-wide
association studies. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for
age, sex, global ancestry, study site, and smoking status.
RESULTS: We identified three novel genomic regions significantly associated
(FDR-corrected P <0.10) with lung cancer risk (rs336958 on 5q14.3, rs7186207 on
16q22.2, and rs11658063 on 17q12). On chromosome16q22.2, rs7186207 was
significantly associated with reduced risk [OR = 0.43; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 0.73-0.89], and functional annotation using GTEx showed rs7186207 modifies 
DHODH gene expression. The minor allele at rs336958 on 5q14.3 was associated with
increased lung cancer risk (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.78), whereas the minor
allele at rs11658063 on 17q12 was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.80; 95%
CI, 0.72-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel associations on chromosomes 5q14.3, 16q22.2, and
17q12, which contain HNF1B, DHODH, and HAPLN1 genes, respectively. SNPs within
these regions have been previously associated with multiple cancers. This is the 
first study to examine cross-cancer pleiotropic associations for lung cancer in
African Americans.
IMPACT: Our findings demonstrate novel cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with
lung cancer risk in African Americans.

The incidence of nonsmoking female patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) has increased in recent decades; however, the pathogenesis of patients is
unclear, and early diagnosis biomarkers are in urgent need. In this study, 136
nonsmoking female subjects (65 patients with NSCLC, 6 patients with benign lung
tumors, and 65 healthy controls) were enrolled, and their metabolic profiling was
investigated by using pseudotargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A
total of 56 annotated metabolites were found and verified to be significantly
different in nonsmoking females with NSCLC compared with the control. The
metabolic profiling was featured by disturbed energy metabolism, amino acid
metabolism, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and so on. Cysteine, serine, and 
1-monooleoylglycerol were defined as the biomarker panel for the diagnosis of
NSCLC patients. 98.5 and 91.4% of subjects were correctly distinguished in the
discovery and validation sets, respectively. The biomarker panel was also useful 
for the diagnosis of in situ malignancy patients, with an accuracy of 97.7 and
97.8% in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. The study provides a
biomarker panel for the auxiliary diagnosis of nonsmoking females with NSCLC.

PURPOSE: There has been burgeoning interest in applying machine learning methods 
for predicting radiotherapy outcomes. However, the imbalanced ratio of a large
number of variables to a limited sample size in radiation oncology constitutes a 
major challenge. Therefore, dimensionality reduction methods can be a key to
success. The study investigates and contrasts the application of traditional
machine learning methods and deep learning approaches for outcome modeling in
radiotherapy. In particular, new joint architectures based on variational
autoencoder (VAE) for dimensionality reduction are presented and their
application is demonstrated for the prediction of lung radiation pneumonitis (RP)
from a large-scale heterogeneous dataset.
METHODS: A large-scale heterogeneous dataset containing a pool of 230 variables
including clinical factors (e.g., dose, KPS, stage) and biomarkers (e.g., single 
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), cytokines and micro-RNAs) in a population of 106
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients who received radiotherapy was used
for modeling RP. 22 patients had grade 2 or higher RP. Four methods were
investigated, including feature selection (case A) and feature extraction (case
B) with traditional machine learning methods, a VAE-MLP joint architecture (case 
C) with deep learning and lastly, the combination of feature selection and
joint-architecture (case D). For feature selection, Random forest (RF), Support
Vector Machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) were implemented to select 
relevant features. Specifically, each method was run for multiple times to rank
features within several cross-validated (CV) resampled sets. A collection of
ranking lists were then aggregated by top 5% and Kemeny graph methods to identify
the final ranking for prediction. A synthetic minority oversampling tech-nique
(SMOTE) was applied to correct for class imbalance during this process. For deep 
learning, a VAE-MLP joint architecture where a VAE aimed for dimensionality
reduction and an MLP aimed for classification was eveloped. In this architecture,
reconstruction loss and prediction loss were combined into a single loss function
to realize simultaneous training and weights were assigned to different classes
to mitigate class imbalance. To evaluate the prediction performance and conduct
comparisons, the area under receiver operating character-istic (ROC) curves
(AUCs) were performed for nested CVs for both handcrafted feature selections and 
the deep learning approach. The significance of differences in AUCs was assessed 
using the DeLong test of U-statistics.
RESULTS: An MLP-based method using weight pruning (WP) feature selection yielded 
the best performance among the different hand-crafted feature selection methods
(case A), reaching an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI: 0.761-0.823) with 29 top features. A 
VAE-MLP joint architecture (case C) achieved a comparable but slightly lower AUC 
of 0.781 (95% CI: 0.737-0.808) with the size of latent dimension being 2. The
combination of handcrafted features (case A) and latent representation (case D)
achieved a significant AUC improvement of 0.831 (95% CI: 0.805-0.863) with 22
features (p-value = 0.000642 compared with handcrafted features only (Case A) and
p-value=0.000453 compared to VAE alone (Case C)) with an MLP classifier.
CONCLUSION: The potential for combination of traditional machine learning methods
and deep learning VAE techniques has been demonstrated for dealing with limited
datasets in modeling radiotherapy toxicities. Specifically, latent variables from
a VAE-MLP joint architecture are able to complement handcrafted features for the 
prediction of RP and improve prediction over either method alone. This article is

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression patterns of transcription factor SOX12 in
lung adenocarcinoma and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the
malignancy.
METHODS: Large cancer genome databases were used to analyze SOX12 expression
level in lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semiquantitative PCR
were used to detect the expression of SOX12 in 36 specimens of lung
adenocarcinoma tissues, 15 adjacent tissues and 21 normal lung tissues. The
prognostic value of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the relationship between
SOX12 expression and the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival
(PPS) of the patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Analysis of TCGA database and GEO (GSE40419) database showed that SOX12 
expression levels were significantly higher in in lung adenocarcinoma than in
normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). The results of IHC and semiquantitative PCR
revealed that SOX12 was expressed at significantly higher levels in lung
adenocarcinoma than in normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis showed that patients with lung adenocarcinoma positive for SOX12 had a
significantly shorter OS and PPS time than those negative for SOX12 (P &lt;
0.05), but SOX12 positivity did not significantly affect OS and PPS of patients
with lung squamous cell carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: High expression levels of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma are
significantly associated with a poor OS of the patients, suggesting the value of 
SOX12 to assist in early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of lung
adenocarcinoma.

OBJECTIVE: To study the clinical value of detecting carcinoembryonic antigen
levels in pleural effusion (PCEA) and serum (SCEA) and their ratio (P/S) in the
differential diagnosis of pleural effusions resulting from tuberculosis and lung 
cancer.
METHODS: This retrospectively study was conducted among 82 patients with pleural 
effusion caused by pulmonary tuberculous (TB; control group) and 120 patients
with pleural effusion resulting from lung cancer in our hospital between April,
2016 and March, 2018. PCEA, SCEA and P/S were compared between the two groups and
among the subgroups of lung cancer patients with squamous cell carcinoma (SqCa), 
adenocarcinoma (ACA), small cell carcinoma (SCLC). The receiveroperating
characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was used to confirm the optimal critical
value to evaluate the diagnostic efficiency of different combinations of PCEA,
SCEA and P/S.
RESULTS: PCEA, SCEA and P/S were significantly higher in the overall cancer
patients and in all the 3 subgroups of cancer patients than in the patients with 
TB (P &lt; 0.05). The areas under the ROC curve of PCEA, SCEA and P/S were 0.925,
0.866 and 0.796, respectively; PCEA had the highest diagnostic value, whose
diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, accurate rate, and diagnostic threshold were
83.33%, 96.34, 88.61%, and 3.26 ng/ml, respectively; SCEA had the lowest
diagnostic performance; the diagnostic performance of P/S was between that of
SCEA and PCEA, but its combination with SCEA greatly improved the diagnostic
performance and reduced the rates of misdiagnosis and missed diagnosis. Parallel 
tests showed that the 3 indexes combined had significantly higher diagnostic
sensitivity than each or any two of the single indexes (P &lt; 0.05), but the
diagnostic specificity did not differ significantly. The area under the ROC curve
of combined detections of the 3 indexes was 0.941 for diagnosis of lung
cancer-related pleural effusion, higher than those of any other combinations of
the indexes.
CONCLUSIONS: The combined detection of PCEA, SCEA and P/S has a high sensitivity 
for diagnosis of lung cancer-related pleural effusion and provides important
information for rapid and accurate diagnosis of suspected cases.

OBJECTIVES: In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), tumour biopsy can often be an
invasive procedure. The development of a non-invasive methodology to study
genetic changes via circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is an appealing concept.
Whilst CTCs typically remain as rare cells, improvements in epitope-independent
CTC isolation techniques has given rise to a greater capture of CTCs. In this
cross sectional study, we demonstrate the capture and characterization of NSCLC
CTCs for the clinically actionable markers epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) alterations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and
programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. The study identified CTCs/CTC
clusters in 26/35 Stage IV NSCLC patients, and subsequently characterized the
CTCs for EGFR mutation, ALK status and PD-L1 status. This pilot study
demonstrates the potential of a non-invasive fluid biopsy to determine clinically
relevant biomarkers in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of degrading and
modifying most components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basal
membrane (BM), and play crucial roles in cancer invasion and metastasis. MMP gene
expressions were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, which was
associated with tumor spread and patient prognosis. Polymorphisms in MMPs have
been reported to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study aim to evaluate the serum levels and polymorphisms of
MMP-9 and MMP-13 in non-small cell lung cancer patients compared to normal
subjects and their correlation to non-small cell lung cancer histopathology
findings in Southern Chinese people.
METHODS: This case⁻control study included 245 patients with NSCLC and 258 healthy
controls. Genomic DNA was extracted by using DNA extraction kit, genotyping was
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) and direct DNA sequencing, and serum levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 were
measured by using a specific ELISA, Human Matrix Metalloproteinase Enzyme
Immunoassay Kits. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 23.0
software package.
RESULTS: The subjects carrying the TT genotype had a decreased risk of lung
cancer in MMP9-1562C/T comparing with the CC genotype (p = 0.00, OR = 0.45, 95%
CI = 0.29⁻0.68), and the MMP13-77 AA genotype was associated with a decreased
risk of NSCLC by comparing with the GG genotype (p = 0.03, OR = 0.56, 95% CI =
0.33⁻0.94). Moreover, the C allele of MMP9-1562C/T could increase serum level of 
NSCLC in compared with the A allele (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.75⁻1.89). Similarly,
the AA genotype of MMP13 might be a marker of decreased serum level of lung
cancer (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.51⁻1.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses underline the support of the notion
that the CC genotype of MMP9-1562C/T and GG genotypes of MMP13-77G/A were
associated with the increased risk NSCLC, and the serum levels of MMP9 and MMP13 
were consistent with the results of the SNP analysis. MMP13 and MMP9 might be
function as a key oncogene in NSCLC with a Southern Chinese population. Combined 
detection of SNP and enzyme activity between MMP9 and MMP13 are expected to be a 
potential diagnostic method of non-small cell lung cancer.

Breath analysis is a promising technique for lung cancer screening. Despite the
rapid development of breathomics in the last four decades, no consistent, robust,
and validated volatile organic compound (VOC) signature for lung cancer has been 
identified. This review summarizes the identified VOC biomarkers from both
exhaled breath analysis and in vitro cultured lung cell lines. Both clinical and 
in vitro studies have produced inconsistent, and even contradictory, results.
Methodological issues that lead to these inconsistencies are reviewed and
discussed in detail. Recommendations on addressing specific issues for more
accurate biomarker studies have also been made.

Liquid biopsy is a technique that utilizes circulating biomarkers in the body
fluids of cancer patients to provide information regarding the genetic landscape 
of the cancer. It is emerging as an alternative and complementary diagnostic and 
prognostic tool to surgical biopsy in oncology. Liquid biopsy focuses on the
detection and isolation of circulating tumor cells, circulating tumor DNA and
exosomes, as a source of genomic and proteomic information in cancer patients.
Liquid biopsy is expected to provide the necessary acceleratory force for the
implementation of precision oncology in clinical settings by contributing an
enhanced understanding of tumor heterogeneity and permitting the dynamic
monitoring of treatment responses and genomic variations. However, widespread
implementation of liquid biopsy based biomarker-driven therapy in the clinical
practice is still in its infancy. Technological advancements have resolved many
of the hurdles faced in the liquid biopsy methodologies but sufficient clinical
and technical validation for specificity and sensitivity has not yet been
attained for routine clinical implementation. This article provides a
comprehensive review of the clinical utility of liquid biopsy and its
effectiveness as an important diagnostic and prognostic tool in colorectal,
breast, hepatocellular, gastric and lung carcinomas which were the five leading
cancer related mortalities in 2018.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear why radiation clinically provides a synergistic
effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The
purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic
efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT)
in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were
administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided
into RT and non-RT groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the 
initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were
treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range:
1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of
nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was
significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients
who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was
particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%,
and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Previous RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable
prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to
nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic 
effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the
outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: Immune system evasion is essential for tumor cell survival and is
mediated by the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment and the activation of
inhibitory immune checkpoints. While immune checkpoint-based therapy yielded
impressive results in several advanced solid malignancies such as melanoma and
non-small cell lung cancer, its role in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and
myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is still evolving. Areas covered: Here we review
the immunology in the tumor microenvironment in the bone marrow and discuss the
current preclinical and clinical data for immune checkpoint-based therapy in
myeloid neoplasms. Expert commentary: Clinical trials of immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICI) in AML and MDS are still in early stages and reported results so
far have been modest especially for monotherapy use in the refractory settings.
However, there are preliminary data for synergistic effects for combination of
multiple ICI with hypomethylating agents and conventional chemotherapy. ICI might
also be effective in eradicating minimal residual disease and to prevent relapse 
following induction chemotherapy or hematopoietic stem cell transplant.
Additional trials to provide insight into the efficacy and safety profile of
immune checkpoint-based therapy, its optimal timing and potential combination
with other types of therapy as well as identification of predictive biomarkers
are needed.

The respiratory epithelium arises from alveolar epithelial progenitors which
differentiate into alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. AT2
cells are stem cells in the lung critical for the repair process after injury.
Mechanisms regulating AT1 and AT2 cell maturation are poorly defined. We report
that the activation of the glucocorticoid pathway in an in vitro alveolar
epithelial lineage differentiation assay led to increased AT2 marker Sftpc and
decreased miR-142 expression. Using miR-142 KO mice, we demonstrate an increase
in the AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Overexpression of miR-142 in alveolar
progenitor cells in vivo led to the opposite effect. Examination of the KO lungs 
at E18.5 revealed enhanced expression of miR-142 targets Apc, Ep300 and Kras
associated with increased β-catenin and p-Erk signaling. Silencing of miR-142
expression in lung explants grown in vitro triggers enhanced Sftpc expression as 
well as increased AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Pharmacological inhibition of
Ep300-β-catenin but not Erk in vitro prevented the increase in Sftpc expression
triggered by loss of miR-142. These results suggest that the
glucocorticoid-miR-142-Ep300-β-catenin signaling axis controls pneumocyte
maturation.

Endogenous biomarkers remain at the forefront of early disease detection efforts,
but many lack the sensitivities and specificities necessary to influence disease 
management. Here, we describe a cell-based in vivo sensor for highly sensitive
early cancer detection. We engineer macrophages to produce a synthetic reporter
on adopting an M2 tumor-associated metabolic profile by coupling luciferase
expression to activation of the arginase-1 promoter. After adoptive transfer in
colorectal and breast mouse tumor models, the engineered macrophages migrated to 
the tumors and activated arginase-1 so that they could be detected by
bioluminescence imaging and luciferase measured in the blood. The macrophage
sensor detected tumors as small as 25-50 mm3 by blood luciferase measurements,
even in the presence of concomitant inflammation, and was more sensitive than
clinically used protein and nucleic acid cancer biomarkers. Macrophage sensors
also effectively tracked the immunological response in muscle and lung models of 
inflammation, suggesting the potential utility of this approach in disease states
other than cancer.

Quantitative radiomics features, extracted from medical images, characterize
tumour-phenotypes and have been shown to provide prognostic value in predicting
clinical outcomes. Stability of radiomics features extracted from apparent
diffusion coefficient (ADC)-maps is essential for reliable correlation with the
underlying pathology and its clinical applications. Within a multicentre,
multi-vendor trial we established a method to analyse radiomics features from
ADC-maps of ovarian (n = 12), lung (n = 19), and colorectal liver metastasis
(n = 30) cancer patients who underwent repeated (<7 days) diffusion-weighted
imaging at 1.5 T and 3 T. From these ADC-maps, 1322 features describing tumour
shape, texture and intensity were retrospectively extracted and stable features
were selected using the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC > 0.85).
Although some features were tissue- and/or respiratory motion-specific, 122
features were stable for all tumour-entities. A large proportion of features were
stable across different vendors and field strengths. By extracting stable
phenotypic features, fitting-dimensionality is reduced and reliable prognostic
models can be created, paving the way for clinical implementation of ADC-based
radiomics.

Deep-frying is a popular form of food preparation used globally and throughout in
the United States. Each time dietary oils are heated to deep-frying temperatures,
they undergo chemical alterations that result in a new matrix of lipid
structures. These lipid products include triglyceride dimers, polymers, oxidized 
triglycerides, and cyclic monomers, which raises nutritional concerns about
associations between these lipid products and heightened health risks. Reports of
associations between thermally abused frying oil and deleterious health outcomes 
currently exist, yet there is little information concerning the effects of
thermally abused frying oil consumption and the progression of breast cancer.
This study used a late-stage breast cancer murine model and in vivo
bioluminescent imaging to monitor progression of metastasis of 4T1 tumor cells in
animals consuming fresh soybean oil (SBO) and a thermally abused frying oil
(TAFO). Bioluminescent and histologic examinations demonstrated that TAFO
consumption resulted in a marked increase of metastatic lung tumor formation
compared to SBO consumption. Further, in animals consuming the TAFO treatment
diet, metastatic tumors in the lung displayed a 1.4-fold increase in the Ki-67
marker of cellular proliferation and RNA-sequencing analysis of the hepatic
tissue revealed a dietary-induced modulation of gene expression in the liver.

INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway deregulation
promotes the acquisition of stemlike properties in non-small-cell lung cancer.
EGFR inhibition through NOTCH enriches lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Src through
Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activates NOTCH. Signal transduction and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurs upon EGFR blockade and
regulates the generation of CSCs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Aldefluor assay kit, we investigated the
enrichment of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells in
EGFR-mutation-positive cells treated with gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib.
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in CSC marker expression 
upon EGFR blockade. We performed gene expression analysis in a cohort of
EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. We evaluated the
association of gene expression with treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: The cell subpopulation surviving EGFR inhibition had high ALDH activity 
and elevated CSC marker expression. Concurrent inhibition of EGFR, STAT3, and Src
diminished the CSC subpopulation in an EGFR-mutation-positive cellular model. In 
a cohort of 64 EGFR-mutation-positive patients, 2 ALDH1 isoforms and the NOTCH
target hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), when highly expressed, were
predictive of worse outcome to EGFR blockade. The gene expression of
B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) that
maintains the self-renewal of stem cells was also related to treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION: Single EGFR inhibitors increase the population of CSCs. Combinatory
therapy targeting STAT3 and Src may be of potential benefit. ALDH1, HES1, and
Bmi-1 are essential biomarkers in the initial assessment of
EGFR-mutation-positive patients.

BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) developed during immunotherapy 
with anti-PD-1 agents, could be a predictive surrogate marker of clinical benefit
in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Patients with NSCLC, treated with anti-PD-1 agents, were retrospectively
evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the
relationships between types of irAEs (differentiated according to system/organ
involved and to single-site/multiple-site), overall response rate (ORR),
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We further performed a
6-week landmark analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 559 patients were enrolled; 231 patients (41.3%) developed
irAEs of any grade and 50 patients (8.9%) G3/G4 events; 191 of them (82.6%)
developed "single-site" irAEs and 40 (17.4%) "multiple-site" irAEs. At
multivariate analysis, higher ORR was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), 
"single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine (P = .0043) and skin irAEs (P =
.0005). Longer PFS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), "single-site"
irAEs (P < .0001), "multiple-site" irAEs (P = .0374), endocrine irAEs (P = .0084)
and skin irAEs (P = .0001). Longer OS was related to irAEs of any grade (P <
.0001), "single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0044),
gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0437), skin irAEs (P = .0006), and others irAEs (P =
.0378). At the 6-week landmark analysis, irAEs of any grade was confirmed an
independent predictor of higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that irAEs are concordantly related to higher
ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with
NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need to explore the predictive biomarkers of
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, 
we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitors.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association
between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in
NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of 
treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1.
RESULTS: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results
suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS
(HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and
prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most
subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1
expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study
quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated
NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P =  0.036) but not for PFS benefit 
(r = 0.198, P =  0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with 
HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P =  0.041).
CONCLUSION: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC
patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive 
and prognostic value in this clinical scenario.

OBJECTIVES: Evidence is rapidly accumulating for the use of radical consolidative
treatment (RCT) for patients with oligometastatic non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Nonetheless, published studies have several limitations, including a
selection of patients whose favorable characteristics might dictate therapeutic
success, as well as scarce prospective data regarding overall survival (OS). The 
objective of this study was to determine whether RCT increases OS in patients
with oligometastatic NSCLC.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective, single-arm phase II study, we sought 
to evaluate the efficacy of RCT in patients with oligometastatic NSCLC in terms
of OS. Patients with pathologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC who presented ≤5
synchronous, any-site metastases (including central nervous system [CNS]
metastases), as assessed by PET-CT, were included. All patients received four
initial cycles of systemic treatment. Following, those with stable
disease/partial response received RCT to the primary site and metastases. The
response to RCT was evaluated with PET-CT. The primary end-point was OS.
Secondary end-points included progression-free survival (PFS) and best response
by PET-CT. The study is registered in clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02805530).
RESULTS: Thirty-seven patients were included in the analysis. The mean age was
55.8 years (range: 33-75 years). At diagnosis, 43.2% of patients presented with
CNS metastases. Following RCT, 19 (51.4%) patients achieved a complete-response
(CR) by PET-CT, while 18 (48.6%) had a non-complete response (NON-CR). The median
OS was nonreached (NR) and was positively affected by CR on PET-CT (NR vs. 27.4
[95% CI: 16.4-38.3]; p = 0.011). The median PFS was 23.5 months (95% CI:
13.6-33.3) and was positively affected by CR on PET-CT (NR vs. 14.3 [95% CI:
11.7-16.9]; p < 0.001; HR: 0.19 [0.07-0.52]; p=0.001).
CONCLUSION: Patients with oligometastatic NSCLC who undergo RCT have a high
response rate and favorable OS. Patients with a CR by PET-CT have significantly
longer OS, rendering this an important potential prognostic marker.

OBJECTIVES: A number of key immune regulators show prognostic value in malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the association between Bridging integrator 1
(BIN1), indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and patient outcome has not been
investigated. We aimed to determine the expression of BIN1 and IDO1, their
association with other markers and impact on overall survival (OS) in MPM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of BIN1, IDO1, CD3, CD20 and CD68 were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 67 patients who underwent
pleurectomy/decortication. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan
Meier method and significant biomarkers were entered into a Cox Regression
multivariate model, accounting for known prognostic factors such as age, gender, 
histological subtype, PD-L1 expression and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.
RESULTS: Immune markers were variably expressed in tumor cells, ranging from 0%
to 100% for BIN1 (median: 89%), and 0% to 77.5% for IDO1 (median: 0%). Expression
of markers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and macrophages ranged from
0% to more than 50%. BIN1 expression was high in 35 patients (51%) and was
associated with increased OS (median: 12 vs 6 months for high and low BIN1
respectively,p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed BIN1 remained an independent
prognostic indicator (HR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.82, p = 0.01). The majority of
patients had immune inflamed tumors (77%) and there was a significant association
between TILs and BIN1 (p = 0 < 0.01), PD-L1 (p=0.04) and CD68+ macrophages in the
tumor (p < 0.01). There were no significant associations between PD-L1 and BIN1
or IDO1.
CONCLUSION: High BIN1 expression is a favorable prognostic biomarker and is
associated with TILs in MPM.

OBJECTIVES: The biomarkers cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) and human
epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are useful in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their combination has not been
investigated yet. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the ability of
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 to predict recurrence as part of follow-up monitoring in
patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from patients with stage
I-IIIA ADC preoperatively and during follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and
then every 6-12 months up to 5 years post-R0 resection. Samples were analyzed for
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 via electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. All cases of disease
recurrence were verified by imaging. The diagnostic performance of CYFRA 21-1,
HE4, and their combination to predict recurrence was assessed by Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) and corresponding area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: 115 patients with ADC were included (N = 612 biomarker measurements);
median age was 63 years; most had stage I-II disease (n = 97; 84.3%). All
patients underwent surgical resection; 44 patients (38%) also received adjuvant
chemotherapy and 16 (14%) received radiation therapy. At the median timepoint for
the last blood sample collection (37 months), 31 patients (27%) had experienced
recurrence. Both CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 were able to detect recurrence (AUC and 95%
confidence interval [CI]): 75.9% (66.0-85.8%) and 75.4% (65.9-84.8%),
respectively, but this increased with the combination (78.8% [69.0-88.6%]). At a 
sensitivity of 80%, the respective specificities (95% CI) for CYFRA 21-1, HE4,
and the combination were 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), and 69.7%
(65.8-73.4%).
CONCLUSION: Serial measurements of serum CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 levels could provide 
a valuable method for follow-up monitoring of patients with ADC to detect
recurrence.

PURPOSE: To identify clinically relevant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
features of different types of metastatic brain lesions, including standard
anatomical, diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) and dynamic susceptibility contrast 
(DSC) perfusion MRI.
METHODS: MRI imaging was retrospectively assessed on one hundred and fourteen
(N = 114) brain metastases including breast (n = 27), non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC, n = 43) and 'other' primary tumors (n = 44). Based on 114 patient's MRI
scans, a total of 346 individual contrast enhancing tumors were manually
segmented. In addition to tumor volume, apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) and
relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) measurements, an independent component
analysis (ICA) was performed with raw DSC data in order to assess arterio-venous 
components and the volume of overlap (AVOL) relative to tumor volume, as well as 
time to peak (TTP) of T2* signal from each component.
RESULTS: Results suggests non-breast or non-NSCLC ('other') tumors had higher
volume compare to breast and NSCLC patients (p = 0.0056 and p = 0.0003,
respectively). No differences in median ADC or rCBV were observed across tumor
types; however, breast and NSCLC tumors had a significantly higher "arterial"
proportion of the tumor volume as indicated by ICA (p = 0.0062 and p = 0.0018,
respectively), while a higher "venous" proportion were prominent in breast tumors
compared with NSCLC (p = 0.0027) and 'other' lesions (p = 0.0011). The AVOL
component was positively related to rCBV in all groups, but no correlation was
found for arterial and venous components with respect to rCBV values. Median time
to peak of arterial and venous components were 8.4 s and 12.6 s, respectively
(p < 0.0001). No difference was found in arterial or venous TTP across groups.
CONCLUSIONS: Advanced ICA-derived component analysis demonstrates perfusion
differences between metastatic brain tumor types that were not observable with
classical ADC and rCBV measurements. These results highlight the complex
relationship between brain tumor vasculature characteristics and the site of
primary tumor diagnosis.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to cancer
progression, and several inflammatory markers have been reported to be associated
with the clinical outcomes in patients with various types of cancer. Recently,
the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) has been developed as a
prognostic marker in patients with lung cancer. The difference between the ALI
and the inflammatory markers reported in the previous studies is that the ALI
contains not only indices related to inflammation but also the body mass index
(BMI), which was reported to correlate with the sarcopenic status. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the ALI in patients
with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 159 patients who underwent
combination chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer between
2008 and 2016. The BMI was calculated by dividing the weight by height squared.
The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated from a blood sample by
dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. The ALI 
was defined as follows: ALI=BMI × serum albumin concentration/NLR.
RESULTS: The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the low-ALI group
than in the high-ALI group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the ALI was an independent 
prognostic factor for the overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.773, 95% confidence
interval: 1.773-4.335, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A newly developed prognostic marker, the ALI, was found to be a
novel prognostic marker in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal
cancer as well as in patients with lung cancer.

Background: Lung cancer is the most common and lethal malignancy worldwide. TCTP 
is highly expressed in various cancers including lung cancer.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) could increase cancer cell invasion.
Whether TCTP's expression is associated with EMT in lung adenocarcinoma is
largely unknown.
Methods: Several Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to analyze the
correlation between TCTP expression and overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma
patients by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Then, 24 surgically removed fresh
lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples and paired paracancer tissue samples were used
to analyze the correlation between TCTP expression and tumor stage by
immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, stable cell lines were generated using
lentiviral transduction systems to knock down or overexpress TCTP in A549 cells. 
Cell migration and invasion were measured by scratch and transwell assays, and
EMT marker proteins such as α-SMA, ZEB1, and E-cadherin were quantitated by
Western blot. The expression levels of miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429 were
determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and their target genes were predicted
by an online database miRTarBase. The interaction between TCTP and these genes
was analyzed by String database and visualized by Cytoscape.
Results: TCTP was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to paracancer
tissues. The expression of TCTP was associated with shorter overall survival.
TCTP knockdown experiment in A549 cells suggested that TCTP knockdown could
decrease the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, and the expression
level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but increase the expression of E-cadherin and p53. Vice 
versa, overexpression of TCTP could increase the migration and invasion of cancer
cells, and the expression level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but decrease the expression of
E-cadherin and p53. Furthermore, we found the expression of miR-200a, miR-141,
and miR-429 was associated with TCTP expression.
Conclusion: TCTP promotes EMT in lung adenocarcinoma, and this effect may be
associated with miR-200 family members like miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429.

Pulmonary cytology is a challenging diagnostic tool, and it is usually evaluated 
considering medical history and radiological findings in order to reach an
accurate diagnosis. Since the majority of lung cancer patients have an advanced
stage at diagnosis, a cytological specimen is frequently the only material
available for diagnosis and further prognostic/predictive marker determination.
Several types of specimens can be obtained from the respiratory system (including
sputum, bronchoalveolar lavage, bronchial brushing, fine needle aspiration, and
pleural fluid) with different technical preclinical management protocols and
different diagnostic yields. Immunocytochemistry (ICC) has a pivotal role in the 
determination of diagnostic, prognostic, and predictive markers. Therefore,
limited cytology samples are to be used with a cell-sparing approach, to allow
both diagnostic ICC evaluation as well as predictive marker assessment by ICC or 
specific molecular assays. In this review, we describe the most common ICC
markers used for the diagnosis and prognostic/predictive characterization of
thoracic tumors in different cytological specimens.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary parenchymal destruction is consequence of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which results in degradation of the
extracellular matrix and the appearance of peripheral pulmonary cells. The aim of
this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the detection and isolation of
Circulating Pulmonary Cells (CPCs) in peripheral blood of patients with COPD.
METHODS: 17 COPD patients were enrolled in this prospective study to isolate
CPCs. Peripheral blood samples for CPC analysis were processed using positive
immunomagnetic methods combined with a double immunocytochemistry. Two
antibodies, anti-cytokeratin and anti-CD44v6 were used to confirm the epithelial 
nature of the isolated cells and their lung origin respectively.
RESULTS: CK/CD44v6 positive CPCs were identified in 6 of 17 COPD patients (35.2% 
of the total) (range: 1-2 cells). No CPCs were detected in any of the 10 healthy 
volunteers. The COPD CPCs + patients showed a trend towards greater severity of
the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest the feasibility to detect CPCs in peripheral
blood of patients with COPD and its potential use as prognostic marker.

The antitumor activity of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif protein inhibitors
(BETi) has been demonstrated across numerous types of cancer. As such, these
inhibitors are currently undergoing widespread clinical evaluation. However,
predictive biomarkers allowing the stratification of tumors into responders and
non-responders to BETi are lacking. Here we showed significant anti-proliferative
effects of low dosage BETi in vitro and in vivo against aggressive ovarian and
lung cancer models lacking SMARCA4 and SMARCA2, key components of SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complexes. Restoration of SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 promoted
resistance to BETi in these models, and conversely, knockdown of SMARCA4
sensitized resistant cells to BETi. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that
exposure to BETi potently downregulated a network of genes involved in receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells, including the
oncogenic RTK HER3. Repression of signaling downstream of HER3 was found to be an
important determinant of response to BETi in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells. Overall,
we propose that BETi represent a rational therapeutic strategy in poor prognosis,
SMARCA4/A2-deficient cancers.

Tissue of Lung Cancer Patients.

The formation of methyl DNA adducts is a critical step in carcinogenesis
initiated by exposure to methylating carcinogens. Methyl DNA phosphate adducts,
formed by methylation of the oxygen atoms of the DNA phosphate backbone, have
been detected in animals treated with methylating carcinogens. However, detection
of these adducts in human tissues has not been reported. We developed an
ultrasensitive liquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-high resolution 
tandem mass spectrometry method for detecting methyl DNA phosphate adducts. Using
50 micrograms of human lung DNA, a limit of quantitation of 2 adducts/1010
nucleobases was achieved. Twenty-two structurally unique methyl DNA phosphate
adducts were detected in human lung DNA. The adduct levels were measured in both 
tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 30 lung cancer patients, including 13
current smokers and 17 current nonsmokers, as confirmed by measurements of
urinary cotinine and NNAL. Levels of total methyl DNA phosphate adducts in normal
lung tissues were higher in smokers than nonsmokers, with an average of 13 and 8 
adducts/109 nucleobases, respectively. Methyl DNA phosphate adducts were also
detected in lung tissues from untreated rats with steady state levels of 5-7
adducts/109 nucleobases over a period of 70 weeks. This is the first study to
report detection of methyl DNA phosphate adducts in human lung tissues. The
results provide new insights towards using these DNA adducts as potential
biomarkers to study human exposure to environmental methylating carcinogens.

Smoking impacts DNA methylation genome-wide in blood of newborns from maternal
smoking during pregnancy and adults from personal smoking. We compared
smoking-related DNA methylation in lung adenocarcinoma (61 never smokers, 91
current smokers, and 238 former smokers) quantified with the Illumina450k
BeadArray in The Cancer Genome Atlas with published large consortium
meta-analyses of newborn and adult blood. We assessed whether CpG sites related
to smoking in blood from newborns and adults were enriched in the lung
adenocarcinoma methylation signal. Testing CpGs differentially methylated by
smoke exposure, we identified 296 in lung adenocarcinoma meeting a P < 10-4
cutoff, while previous meta-analyses identified 3,042 in newborn blood, and 8,898
in adult blood meeting the same P < 10-4 cutoff. Lung signals were highly
enriched for those seen in newborn (24 overlapping CpGs,
Penrichment = 1.2 × 10-18) and adult blood (66 overlapping CpGs,
Penrichment = 1.2 × 10-48). The 105 genes annotated to CpGs differentially
methylated in lung tumors, but not blood, were enriched for RNA processing
ontologies. Some epigenetic alterations associated with cigarette smoke exposure 
are tissue specific, but others are common across tissues. These findings support
the value of blood-based methylation biomarkers for assessing exposure effects in
target tissues.

BACKGROUND: Breast cancer patient-derived xenograft (BC-PDX) models represent a
continuous and reproducible source of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for studying
their role in tumor biology and metastasis. We have previously shown the utility 
of BC-PDX models in the study of CTCs by immunohistochemistry (IHC) on serial
paraffin sections and manual microscopic identification of cytokeratin-positive
cells, a method that is both low-throughput and labor-intensive. We therefore
aimed to identify and characterize CTCs from small volume mouse blood samples and
examined its practical workflow in a study of BC-PDX mice treated with
chemotherapy using an automated imaging platform, the AccuCyte®-CyteFinder®
system.
METHODS: CTC analysis was conducted using blood from non-tumor bearing SCID/Beige
mice spiked with human breast cancer cells, BC-PDX-bearing mice, and BC-PDX mice 
treated with vehicle or chemotherapeutic agent(s). After red blood cell lysis,
nucleated cells were mixed with transfer solution, processed onto microscope
slides, and stained by immunofluorescence. The CyteFinder automated scanning
microscope was used to identify CTCs, defined as nucleated cells that were human 
cytokeratin-positive, and mouse CD45-negative. Disaggregated primary BC-PDX
tumors and lung metastatic nodules were processed using the same immunostaining
protocol. Collective expression of breast cancer cell surface markers (EpCAM,
EGFR, and HER2) using a cocktail of target-specific antibodies was assessed. CTCs
and disaggregated tumor cells were individually retrieved from slides using the
CytePicker® module for sequence analysis of a BC-PDX tumor-specific PIK3CA
mutation.
RESULTS: The recovery rate of human cancer cells spiked into murine blood was
83 ± 12%. CTC detection was not significantly different from the IHC method.
One-third of CTCs did not stain positive for cell surface markers. A PIK3CA
T1035A mutation present in a BC-PDX tumor was confirmed in isolated single CTCs
and cells from dissociated metastatic nodules after whole genome amplification
and sequencing. CTC evaluation could be simply implemented into a preclinical PDX
therapeutic study setting with substantial improvements in workflow over the IHC 
method.
CONCLUSIONS: Analysis of small volume blood samples from BC-PDX-bearing mice
using the AccuCyte-CyteFinder system allows investigation of the role of CTCs in 
tumor biology and metastasis independent of surface marker expression.

Cancer prognosis is of essential interest, and extensive research has been
conducted searching for biomarkers with prognostic power. Recent studies have
shown that both omics profiles and histopathological imaging features have
prognostic power. There are also studies exploring integrating the two types of
measurements for prognosis modeling. However, there is a lack of study rigorously
examining whether omics measurements have independent prognostic power
conditional on histopathological imaging features, and vice versa. In this
article, we adopt a rigorous statistical testing framework and test whether an
individual gene expression measurement can improve prognosis modeling conditional
on high-dimensional imaging features, and a parallel analysis is conducted
reversing the roles of gene expressions and imaging features. In the analysis of 
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung adenocarcinoma and liver hepatocellular
carcinoma data, it is found that multiple individual genes, conditional on
imaging features, can lead to significant improvement in prognosis modeling;
however, individual imaging features, conditional on gene expressions, only offer
limited prognostic power. Being among the first to examine the independent
prognostic power, this study may assist better understanding the "connectedness" 
between omics profiles and histopathological imaging features and provide
important insights for data integration in cancer modeling.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer immunotherapy represents a major therapeutic breakthrough.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in the context of a combination are
considered the new standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Areas covered: This review explains the biologic rationale behind the
implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the therapy of advanced NSCLC.
It provides a detailed description of the clinical trials that have studied the
various agents now in use and the results that lead to the currently approved
indications. It also explores the area of established and developing biomarkers, 
and the trends of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities
(chemotherapy, antiangiogenic agents, radiotherapy), or with other immune
modulators. Expert opinion: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been established as
the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. They can be
administered according to PD-L1 expression upfront as monotherapy or in
combination with chemotherapy- regardless of PD-L1 status - or in the later lines
of therapy. They also represent a less toxic and more effective treatment choice 
than chemotherapy alone. The development of reliable biomarkers for patient
selection and the subsequent use of the appropriate immune-based approach for
each patient will define the role of immunotherapy in the years to come.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore biological functions of differentially expressed 
miRNAs during carcinogenesis, to identify miRNAs dysegulations involved in DNA
repair mechanisms, and to evaluate potential of miRNAs as prognostic and
diagnostic biomarkers for early lung adenocarcinomas (LAC).
METHODS: We obtained 21 LAC and paired adjacent normal formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded lung tissues from patients who underwent curative resection for
stage I LAC. We compared expression levels of eight miRNAs involved in DNA repair
mechanism between LAC and adjacent tissues.
RESULTS: Expressions of Hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p,
hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-let-7a-5p were significantly
up-regulated in stage I LAC tissues compared with those in adjacent tissues. In
addition, expressions of hsa-mir-9-5p, hsa-mir-24-3p, hsa-mir-125a-3p,
hsa-mir-125b-5p, and hsa-mir-155-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage Ia
LAC tissues, whereas expressions of hsa-mir-125a-3p and hsa-mir-125b-5p were
significantly up-regulated in stage Ib LAC tissues. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that AUROC of hsa-mir-125b-5p was 0.875 (P
< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Expression of hsa-mir-125b-5p could be used to distinguish LAC from
adjacent tissues. Our result suggests that hsa-mir125b-5p can be a prognostic and
diagnostic biomarker for LAC.

As a noninvasive blood testing, the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
methylation in plasma has raised an increasing interest due to diagnostic
applications. Although extensively used in cfDNA methylation analysis, bisulfite 
sequencing is less cost-effective. In this study, we investigated the cfDNA
methylation patterns in lung cancer patients by MeDIP-seq. Compared with the
healthy individuals, 330 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at gene
promoters were identified in lung cancer patients with 33 hypermethylated and 297
hypomethylated regions, respectively. Moreover, these hypermethylated genes were 
validated with the publicly available DNA methylation data, yielding a set of ten
significant differentially methylated genes in lung cancer, including B3GAT2,
BCAR1, HLF, HOPX, HOXD11, MIR1203, MYL9, SLC9A3R2, SYT5, and VTRNA1-3. Our study 
demonstrated MeDIP-seq could be effectively used for cfDNA methylation profiling 
and identified a set of potential biomarker genes with clinical application for
lung cancer.

Diagnostic value of microRNA (miR)-197 and miR-145 in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and their relationship with the clinicopathological parameters of NSCLC
patients were investigated. Seventy-six patients with NSCLC admitted to Jimo
Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2016 to March 2018 were
enrolled in group A, while 60 healthy who received health examinations during the
same period were enrolled in group B. The relative expression levels of serum
miR-197 and miR-145 were detected by RT-qPCR. The relative expression of serum
miR-197 in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (P<0.001); the
relative expression of serum miR-145 in group A was significantly lower than that
in group B (P<0.001); serum miR-197 in group A showed association with the
clinical stage of NSCLC patients (P<0.001); serum miR-145 in group A was
associated with the clinical stage and pathological differentiation of patients
with NSCLC (P<0.001). The AUC of serum miR-197 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.864 (95% 
CI: 0.804-0.924), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.68% and a specificity of
85.00%; the AUC of serum miR-145 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.879 (95% CI:
0.824-0.934), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.21% and a specificity of
71.67%; the AUC of the diagnosis of the combination of serum miR-197 and miR-145 
for NSCLC was 0.952 (95% CI: 0.919-0.984), with a diagnostic sensitivity of
92.10% and a specificity of 78.33%. miR-197 and miR-145 are potential new
biomarkers in the diagnosis of NSCLC due to their possible involvement in the
occurrence and development of NSCLC. With good sensitivity and specificity of
single miR-197 and single miR-145 for the diagnosis of NSCLC, the combined
detection of miR-197 and miR-145 can achieve a better sensitivity in the
diagnosis of NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a potential
biomarker predicting response to anti-programmed cell death-1 protein receptor
(PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 protein ligand (PD-L1) therapy, but few studies
have explored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) TMB in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with NSCLC with ctDNA testing were
retrospectively evaluated from a single institution, along with a validation
cohort from a second institution. ctDNA TMB was derived using the number of
detected mutations over the DNA sequencing length.
RESULTS: Higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with smoking history
(p < .05, chi-squared test). Among patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors (n = 20), higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with shorter
progressive free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 45 vs. 355 days; hazard
ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-24.6; p < .01, and OS 106 days
vs. not reached; HR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.3-27.1; p < .01, respectively). In a small
independent validation cohort (n = 12), there was a nonsignificant numerical
difference for higher ctDNA TMB predicting shorter OS but not PFS. ctDNA TMB was 
not correlated with RECIST tumor burden estimation in the subset of patients
treated with immune checkpoint blockade.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that higher ctDNA TMB, at the current
commercial sequencing length, reflects worse clinical outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Biomarkers to identify patients who will respond to
immune checkpoint blockade are critical. Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has
emerged as a viable biomarker to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, but
few studies have explored the meaning and potential clinical significance of
noninvasive, blood-based TMB. Here, we investigated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
TMB and present data demonstrating that current ctDNA TMB may reflect tumor
burden and that ctDNA panels with a greater number of mutations may be necessary 
to more accurately reflect tissue TMB.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of lung cancer mortality. Bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a component of the cancer
microenvironment and contribute to cancer progression. Intratumoral hypoxia
affects both cancer and stromal cells. Exosomes are recognized as mediators of
intercellular communication. Here, we aim to further elucidate the communication 
between BMSC-derived exosomes and cancer cells in the hypoxic niche.
METHODS: Exosomal miRNA profiling was performed using a microRNA array. Lung
cancer cells and an in vivo mouse syngeneic tumor model were used to evaluate the
effects of select exosomal microRNAs. Hypoxic BMSC-derived plasma exosomal miRNAs
were assessed for their capacity to discriminate between cancer patients and
non-cancerous controls and between cancer patients with or without metastasis.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that exosomes derived from hypoxic BMSCs are taken by
neighboring cancer cells and promote cancer cell invasion and EMT.
Exosome-mediated transfer of select microRNAs, including miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p 
and miR-5100, from BMSCs to epithelial cancer cells activates STAT3 signaling and
increases the expression of mesenchymal related molecules. The diagnostic
accuracy of individual microRNA showed that plasma exosomal miR-193a-3p can
discriminate cancer patients from non-cancerous controls. A panel of these three 
plasma exosomal microRNAs showed a better diagnostic accuracy to discriminate
lung cancer patients with or without metastasis than individual exosomal
microRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100,
could promote invasion of lung cancer cells by activating STAT3
signalling-induced EMT. These exosomal miRNAs may be promising noninvasive
biomarkers for cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the most frequent type of lung 
cancer is associated with extensive mortality. Researchers have studied the
suitability of several molecules as biomarkers for early detection of this
cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as the main regulators of gene expression 
have also been assessed in this regard.
METHODS: In the present study, we compared expression level of Fas-antisense 1
(FAS-AS1), Growth Arrest Specific 5 (GAS5), PVT1, Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly
Transcript 1 (NEAT1), HOXA transcript antisense RNA myeloid-specific 1
(HOTAIRM1), taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) and TNFα and hnRNPL related
immunoregulatory LincRNA (THRIL) in 32 NSCLC samples and their corresponding
adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs).
RESULTS: NEAT1 has been significantly over-expressed in NSCLC tissues obtained
from male subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (Relative expression
(REx) = 3.022, P = 0.019) but not in female subjects (P = 0.975). FAS-AS1 was
significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues obtained from both males and
females subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (REx = - 4.12 and - 3.14, 
P = 0.015 and 0.033 respectively). TUG1, GAS5, THRIL and HOTAIRM1 were
significantly down-regulated in tumoral tissues obtained from male subjects
compared with the corresponding ANCTs.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed dysregulation of these lncRNAs in NSCLC tissues
compared with the corresponding ANCTs warrants future studies to confirm the
results of the current study in larger sample sizes to elaborate their role as
cancer biomarkers.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LA) is the most commonly occurring histological type of
non‑small cell lung cancer. Diagnosis and treatment of LA remain a major clinical
challenge. In the present study, to identify early LA biomarkers, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) were separated from the plasma samples from 153 patients with LA
and 75 healthy controls. microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling was performed at
the screening stage (5 patients with LA vs. 5 controls), followed by verification
at the validation stage (40 patients with LA vs. 20 controls) using reverse
transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The four
disordered miRNAs (miR‑505‑5p, miR‑486‑3p, miR‑486‑3p and miR‑382‑3p) identified 
in the plasma EVs were further evaluated at the testing stage (108 patients with 
LA vs. 50 controls) by RT‑qPCR. It was revealed that miR‑505‑5p was upregulated, 
whereas miR‑382‑3p was downregulated, in the EVs from patients with LA.
Furthermore, miR‑505‑5p was also upregulated in tumor tissues, compared with
adjacent non‑tumor control tissues. Subsequently, the direct targets of
miR‑505‑5p were predicted using bioinformatics analyses, and verified by
luciferase assay and immunoblotting. The present study determined that miR‑505‑5p
functions as an oncogene, promoting lung cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting
cancer cell apoptosis via the targeting of tumor protein P53‑regulated
apoptosis‑inducing protein 1 (TP53AIP1). Finally, it was confirmed that
miR‑505‑5p in plasma EVs could be delivered to lung cancer cells, inhibiting cell
apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation by targeting TP53AIP1. In conclusion, 
the present study indicated that miRNA‑505‑5p functions as an oncogene that may
be used as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of LA.

A repository of microbial marker genes related to human health and diseases for
host phenotype prediction using microbiome data.

Author information: 
(1)Computer Science Department, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47408, USA.

The microbiome research is going through an evolutionary transition from focusing
on the characterization of reference microbiomes associated with different
environments/hosts to the translational applications, including using microbiome 
for disease diagnosis, improving the effcacy of cancer treatments, and prevention
of diseases (e.g., using probiotics). Microbial markers have been identified from
microbiome data derived from cohorts of patients with different diseases,
treatment responsiveness, etc, and often predictors based on these markers were
built for predicting host phenotype given a microbiome dataset (e.g., to predict 
if a person has type 2 diabetes given his or her microbiome data). Unfortunately,
these microbial markers and predictors are often not published so are not
reusable by others. In this paper, we report the curation of a repository of
microbial marker genes and predictors built from these markers for
microbiome-based prediction of host phenotype, and a computational pipeline
called Mi2P (from Microbiome to Phenotype) for using the repository. As an
initial effort, we focus on microbial marker genes related to two diseases, type 
2 diabetes and liver cirrhosis, and immunotherapy efficacy for two types of
cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and renal cell carcinoma (RCC). We
characterized the marker genes from metagenomic data using our recently developed
subtractive assembly approach. We showed that predictors built from these
microbial marker genes can provide fast and reasonably accurate prediction of
host phenotype given microbiome data. As understanding and making use of
microbiome data (our second genome) is becoming vital as we move forward in this 
age of precision health and precision medicine, we believe that such a repository
will be useful for enabling translational applications of microbiome data.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: We determined the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of 
long-term response to pemetrexed maintenance therapy as first-line treatment for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A total of 950 advanced NSCLC patients received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 ) 
plus cisplatin (60 mg/m2 ) (Pem-Cis) induction chemotherapy every three weeks as 
first-line treatment between January 2010 and August 2018. Patients who did not
show progression after four cycles of Pem-Cis and received at least one cycle of 
pemetrexed maintenance were recruited (n = 199).
RESULTS: Patients were divided into subgroups according to total cycles of
pemetrexed: ≤ 10 (F10, n = 134) and > 10 (M10, n = 65). The M10 group had a
higher proportion of patients with stage M1a (intrathoracic metastasis alone) and
exhibited lower levels of thymidylate synthase (TS) than the F10 group (median
H-score 10.0% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.031). Further subgrouping identified extreme
responders: ≤ 7 (F7, n = 101) and ≥ 20 (M20, n = 26) cycles. The M20 group showed
lower mean serum CEA levels before (17.5 vs. 147.0; P = 0.099) and after (6.9 vs.
53.2; P = 0.001) Pem-Cis treatment, and a higher incidence of normalization after
Pem-Cis (abnormal 41.7% vs. 68.5%; P = 0.015). M1a stage, normalization of CEA
levels after Pem-Cis, and lower TS H-score were predictors of progression-free
survival in patients administered pemetrexed maintenance.
CONCLUSION: M1a stage and lower TS expression were predictors of long-term
response to pemetrexed maintenance. CEA normalization after Pem-Cis could be an
additional surrogate marker of positive response to long-term treatment.

A ground glass opacity (GGO) lung lesion may represent early stage
adenocarcinoma, which has an excellent prognosis upon prompt surgical resection. 
However, GGO lesions have broad differential diagnoses, including both benign and
malignant lesions. Our objective was to study telomere length and telomerase
activity in patients with suspected lung cancer in which GGO was the predominant 
radiographic feature. Knowledge of telomere biology may help distinguish
malignant from benign radiographic lesions and guide risk assessment of these
lesions. Peripheral blood samples were taken from 22 patients with suspected
adenocarcinoma with the GGO radiographic presentation. Multidisciplinary
discussion confirmed the need for surgery in all cases. We used an age and
gender-matched group without known lung disease as a control. Telomere length and
aggregates were assessed by quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridization
(QFISH) and quantitative PCR. Cell senescence was evaluated by
senescence-associated heterochromatin foci. Subjects with GGO lesions had a
higher percentage of lymphocytes with shorter telomeres (Q-FISH, P = 0.003).
Furthermore, relative telomere length was also reduced among the GGO cases (qPCR,
P < 0.05). Increased senescence was observed in the GGO group compared to
controls (P < 0.001), with significant correlation between the
senescence-associated heterochromatin foci and aggregate formation (r = -0.7 and 
r = -0.44 for cases and controls, respectively). In conclusion, patients with
resectable early adenocarcinoma demonstrate abnormal telomere length and cell
senescence in peripheral blood leukocytes compared to control subjects. Abnormal 
telomere biology in the peripheral blood may increase suspicion of early
adenocarcinoma among patients with GGO lesions.

Novel molecular targets and promising targeted therapies have reshaped
diagnostics in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite
this progress, the implementation of molecular screening to identify predictive
biomarkers in Indian clinical and pathology settings has been challenging due to 
operational and logistical constraints. This consensus guideline brings together 
medical oncologists, molecular pathologists and pathologists from India to
provide a quick and competent reference for biomarker testing in NSCLC. The
guideline summarizes the importance of targetable mutations in NSCLC such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma
kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by ROS-1 gene, overexpression of
programmed cell death ligand-1 and resistant EGFR mutations. It reaffirms
recommendations from international working groups, discusses vulnerable
pre-analytical procedures and provides a balanced review on the pros and cons of 
different diagnostic tests (immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, polymerase chain reaction-based testing and next-generation
sequencing). The document also provides an algorithm to aid diagnostic
decision-making and a checklist to assess the quality of testing laboratories
that will help the medical oncologists make an informed choice. Overall, these
recommendations are based on evidence and clinical experience and will aid
policymakers, oncologists, health care practitioners and pathologists who strive 
to implement molecular strategies and make informed decisions for improved care
in NSCLC in India.Funding: AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China, and approximately one 
third of these cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung. Ethnic
diversity and country-specific environmental factors can account for
interindividual variations in response to and tolerability of anticancer
therapies. Although several targeted therapies have recently been approved for
patients with relapsed/refractory SqCC of the lung, only afatinib, an
irreversible ErbB family blocker, has data of Chinese patients. In the Phase III 
LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit vs the
reversible first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in both the 
overall population and the Chinese subset, with a manageable safety profile.
Emerging biomarker data from LUX-Lung 8 suggest that patients with ErbB
mutations, especially ErbB2, and those classified as "good" in the VeriStrat®
proteomic test, may benefit from afatinib treatment in particular, regardless of 
ethnicity, and may get a long-term response. In conclusion, afatinib is a valid
second-line option for Chinese patients with SqCC of the lung, and specific
biomarkers may help guide in treatment decision-making. Ongoing studies will
provide further guidance on afatinib's place in the treatment algorithm,
alongside the other novel targeted therapies.

To summarize the therapeutic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting, we attempted
to identify potential molecular biomarkers or clinical factors that reflected the
therapeutic effect. The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the
outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until
May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint
and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease
control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy
was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and
we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank
test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24
patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had 
died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line
treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line
treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line
treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). 
Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%).
Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%.
The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach
the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced
non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical
trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 
70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years
old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive
more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential
patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on
brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1
intracranial efficacy.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a master regulator of mitosis and the DNA damage
response, is considered to be an intriguing target in the research field of
mitotic intervention. The observation that Plk1 is overexpressed in multiple
human malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gave rise to
the development of several small-molecule inhibitors. Volasertib, presently the
most extensively studied Plk1 inhibitor, has been validated to efficiently reduce
tumor growth in preclinical settings. Unfortunately, only modest antitumor
activity against solid tumors was reported in clinical trials. This discrepancy
prompted research into the identification of predictive biomarkers. In this
study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of volasertib monotherapy (i.e.,
cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cell death, cellular senescence,
and migration) in a panel of NSCLC cell lines differing in p53 status under both 
normal and reduced oxygen tension (<0.1% O2 ). A strong growth inhibitory effect 
was observed in p53 wild-type cells (A549 and A549-NTC), with IC50 values
significantly lower than those in p53 knockdown/mutant cells (A549-920 and
NCI-H1975) (P < 0.001). While mitotic arrest was significantly greater in cells
with nonfunctional p53 (P < 0.005), apoptotic cell death (P < 0.026) and cellular
senescence (P < 0.021) were predominantly induced in p53 wild-type cells.
Overall, the therapeutic effect of volasertib was reduced under hypoxia
(P < 0.050). Remarkably, volasertib inhibited cell migration in all cell lines
tested (P < 0.040), with the exception of for the NCI-H1975 p53 mutant cell line.
In conclusion, our results show an important difference in the therapeutic effect
of Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC cells with versus without functional p53. Overall,
the p53 wild-type cell lines were more sensitive to volasertib treatment,
suggesting that p53 might be a predictive biomarker for Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC.
Moreover, our results pave the way for new combination strategies with Plk1
inhibitors to enhance antitumor activity.

This study evaluated the efficacy and toxicity of erlotinib and celecoxib (EC)
for treating Chinese patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (ANSCLC)
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) wild type.Totally, 75 subjects with
ANSCLC and EGFR wild type were included. They all underwent EC treatment. The
outcome measurements consisted of progression-free survival (PFS), overall
survival (OS), complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease
(SD), progress disease (PD), and disease control rate (DCR). Additionally,
adverse events were also documented.Two-year CR, PR, SD, PD, and DCR were 4.0%,
6.7%, 42.6%, 46.7%, and 53.3% respectively. The median PFS was 3.4 months, the
median OS was 10.0 months. Additionally, acceptable toxicities were recorded in
this study.The results showed that EC may be efficacious for patients with ANSCLC
and EGFR wild type only, and acceptable toxicity among the Chinese Han
population.

BIM deletion polymorphism predicts poor response to EGFR-TKIs in nonsmall cell
lung cancer: An updated meta-analysis.

BACKGROUND: A germline deletion in BIM (B cell lymphoma-2-like 11) gene has been 
shown to impair the apoptotic response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro but its impact on response to
EGFR-TKIs in patients of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial.
METHODS: Eligible literature were searched and screened. Objective response rate 
(ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were extracted and aggregated with odds
ratio (OR). Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted and
aggregated based on random-effect model.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies including 2694 NSCLC patients were eligible.
Individuals harboring BIM deletion polymorphism had inferior ORR (OR = 0.49, 95% 
CI: 0.34-0.70, P < .001), inferior DCR (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30-0.84, P = .009). 
Patients with BIM deletion had shorter OS despite of the heterogeneity between
countries (in subgroup of South Korea and Taiwan, HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.53,
P < .001; in subgroup of other countries, HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 2.03-2.91,
P < .001). The pooled analysis of PFS showed great heterogeneity (I = 79%). All
the reported characteristics did not account for the heterogeneity. However, 2
subgroups could be obtained through sensitivity analysis. In one subgroup,
patients with BIM deletion polymorphism had shorter PFS (HR = 2.03, 95% CI:
1.71-2.40, P < .001), while in the other subgroup, no significant difference was 
observed (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06, P = .25).
CONCLUSION: NSCLC patients with BIM deletion polymorphism show poor ORR, DCR, and
OS after EGFR-TKIs treatment. BIM deletion polymorphism indicates poor response
to EGFR-TKIs, and it could be used as a predictor to identify those who would
benefit from EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between OCT4 and clinicopathological features in lung
cancer is controversial from the recently publications. Therefore, we conducted
this meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the prognostic and
clinicopathologic characteristics of OCT4 in lung cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
Library, WOS, CNKI and Wanfang databases was performed to identify studies.
Correlations between OCT4 expression and survival outcomes or clinicopathological
features were analyzed using meta-analysis methods.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies with 2523 patients were included. High OCT4
expression has a poorer overall survival (OS) (univariate: HR= 2.00, 95% CI =
(1.68, 2.39), p<0.0001; multivariate: HR= 2.43, 95% CI = (1.67, 3.55), p<0.0001) 
and median overall survival (MSR = 0.51, 95% CI = (0.44, 0.58), p < 0.0001),
disease-free survival (DFS) (HR= 2.18, 95% CI = (1.30, 3.67), p = 0.003) and
poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR= 2.23, 95% CI = (1.21, 4.11), p =
0.010). Furthermore, high OCT4 expression related with lower 5 year
disease-specific survival rate (OR= 0.24, 95% CI = (0.14, 0.41), p<0.0001) and 10
year overall survival rate (OR= 0.22, 95% CI = (0.12, 0.40), p=0.0001).
Additionally, OCT4-high expression was also strongly associated with higher
clinical TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor distant metastasis, higher
histopathologic grade, but not related with gender, smoking status, tumor size
and histologic type of lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: OCT4 over-expression in lung cancer was strongly related poorer
clinicopathological features and worse survival outcomes, which suggests that
OCT4 could be a valuable prognostic marker in lung cancer.

PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES:: We aimed to assess the predictive value of a lung cancer
gene panel for the development of brain metastases.
MATERIALS/METHODS:: Between 2011 and 2015, 102 patients with lung cancer were
prospectively enrolled in a clinical trial in which a diagnostic fine-needle
aspirate was obtained. Gene expression was conducted on all samples that rendered
a diagnosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Subsequent retrospective
analysis of brain metastases-related outcomes was performed by reviewing patient 
electronic medical records. A competing risk multivariable regression was
performed to estimate the adjusted hazard ratio for the development of brain
metastases and non-brain metastases from NSCLC.
RESULTS:: A total of 49 of 102 patients had died by the last follow-up. Median
time of follow-up was 13 months (range 0.23-67 months). A total of 17 patients
developed brain metastases. Median survival time after diagnosis of brain
metastases was 3.58 months (95% confidence interval (CI) 2.17, not available). A 
total of 30 patients developed metastases without any evidence of brain
metastases until the time of death or last follow-up. Competing risk analysis
identified three genes that were downregulated differentially in the patients
with brain metastases versus non-brain metastatic disease: CD37 (0.017), cystatin
A (0.022), and IL-23A (0.027). Other factors associated with brain metastases
include: stage T ( P ⩽ 8.3e-6) and stage N ( P= 6.8e-4).
CONCLUSIONS:: We have identified three genes, CD37, cystatin A, and IL-23A, for
which downregulation of gene expression was associated with a greater propensity 
for developing brain metastases. Validation of these biomarkers could have
implications on surveillance patterns in patients with brain metastases from
NSCLC.

The impact of the tumor immune microenvironment on overall survival in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been studied, but there is little information on its
relevance for risk of relapse after surgery. Understanding more about the immune 
microenvironment in previously untreated NSCLC could help in identifying
high-risk patients and patients more likely to benefit from neoadjuvant/ adjuvant
immunotherapy. Here, we examined gene expression in 399 surgically-derived NSCLC 
samples and 47 samples from normal lung, using Agilent microarray and RNA
sequencing. In 335 of the tumor samples programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression was used to
estimate content of immune cells and to calculate an immune score. Properties of 
the immune microenvironment, and its impact on prognosis, were compared in
histological subgroups and gene expression subtypes. Tumors with an active immune
microenvironment were found for both adenocarcinomas (AD) and squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC). In AD, high immune score and high estimates of several immune
cell types belonging to the adaptive immune system were associated with better
progression free survival (PFS), while in SCC, no association between immune
characteristics and PFS was found. The immune microenvironment, including PD-L1
expression, and its impact on prognosis showed clear differences in AD and SCC
gene expression subtypes. In conclusion, the NSCLC immune microenvironment is
predictive of prognosis after surgery. Lung AD and SCC gene expression subtypes
should be investigated as potential prognostic biomarkers in patients treated
with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We identified computational imaging features on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (PET) that predict recurrence/progression in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively identified 291 patients with NSCLC from 2
prospectively acquired cohorts (training, n = 145; validation, n = 146). We
contoured the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on all pretreatment PET images and
added a 3-dimensional penumbra region that extended outward 1 cm from the tumor
surface. We generated 512 radiomics features, selected 435 features based on
robustness to contour variations, and then applied randomized sparse regression
(LASSO) to identify features that predicted time to recurrence in the training
cohort. We built Cox proportional hazards models in the training cohort and
independently evaluated the models in the validation cohort. Two features
including stage and a MTV plus penumbra texture feature were selected by LASSO.
Both features were significant univariate predictors, with stage being the best
predictor (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.95], P 
< .001). However, adding the MTV plus penumbra texture feature to stage
significantly improved prediction (P = .006). This multivariate model was a
significant predictor of time to recurrence in the training cohort (concordance =
0.74 [95% CI: 0.66-0.81], P < .001) that was validated in a separate validation
cohort (concordance = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67-0.81], P < .001). A combined radiomics
and clinical model improved NSCLC recurrence prediction. FDG PET radiomic
features may be useful biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and add clinical
utility for risk stratification.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NEF is a newly discovered lncRNA, which exhibits an 
inhibitory function on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its
involvement in other types of malignancy are unknown. In the present study, tumor
and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and blood was obtained from patients with NSCLC and healthy
individuals. Expression levels of lncRNA-NEF in tumor tissue samples, healthy
tissue samples and serum were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis and survival curve analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic
and prognostic value of serum lncRNA-NEF for NSCLC. The effects of lncRNA-NEF
overexpression in NSCLC cell lines on tumor cell proliferation, glucose uptake,
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression and mRNA expression were
investigated by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, glucose uptake assay, western blot
analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. It was identified that lncRNA-NEF was
downregulated in NSCLC tissues, compared with healthy controls, and the serum
level of lncRNA-NEF was negatively associated with primary tumor stage.
Therefore, serum lncRNA-NEF may be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker
for NSCLC. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEF inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and
glucose uptake, and downregulated GLUT1 expression. Therefore, it can be
concluded that lncRNA-NEF can target glucose transportation to inhibit the
proliferation of NSCLC cells.

KRAS is the most frequent oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a
molecular subset characterized by historical disappointments in targeted
treatment approaches such as farnesyl transferase inhibition, downstream MEK
inhibition, and synthetic lethality screens. Unlike other important mutational
subtypes of NSCLC, preclinical work supports the hypothesis that KRAS mutations
may be vulnerable to immunotherapy approaches, an efficacy associated in
particular with TP53 co-mutation. In this review we detail reasons for previous
failures in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, evidence to suggest that KRAS mutation is a
genetic marker of benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition, and emerging direct 
inhibitors of K-Ras which will soon be combined with immunotherapy during
clinical development. With signs of real progress in this subgroup of unmet need,
we anticipate that KRAS mutant NSCLC will be the most important molecular subset 
of cancer to evaluate the combination of small molecules and immune checkpoint
inhibitors (CPI).

BACKGROUND: Metastatic spinal cord compression (MSCC) is a severe complication in
patients with cancer, and its incidence rate is difficult to accurately estimate.
The aim of this study is to report the incidence and epidemiological and
prognostic characteristics of MSCC in patients with cancer.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: We analysed a cohort of 1736 patients diagnosed with cancer
of any origin who were hospitalised in a palliative care unit. We collected
epidemiological data, signs and symptoms, mean time to diagnosis, treatment
regimen, response to treatment and mortality for the patients diagnosed with
MSCC.
RESULTS: In the 1736 patients, we identified 28 (1.6%) cases of MSCC. The average
age was 67.2 (SD, 12.7) years, and lung cancer was the most common primary tumour
(42.8%). The thoracic spine was the most affected location (12 cases, 42.8%), and
pain was the predominant symptom (13 cases, 46.4%). The median survival after the
MSCC diagnosis was 84.5 days.
CONCLUSIONS: We observed an incidence rate of 1.6% (N=28) for MSCC in a cohort of
1736 patients with cancer. MSCC is a marker of poor prognosis, with a mean
survival of less than 3 months from diagnosis and a hospital mortality of 32.4%.

Mean platelet volume (MPV), the most commonly used measure of platelet size, and 
is altered in patients with malignancies. The aim of this study was to
investigate the effect of MPV on overall survival (OS) of patients with locally
advanced (Stage IIIA/B) inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This
retrospective study included patients who received concomitant chemoradiotherapy 
(CCRT) with cisplatin + etoposide regimen due to locally advanced stage IIIA/B
NSCLC. The study included a total of 115 cases, consisting of 110 (95.7%) male
and 5 (4.2%) female patients. The mean age of the patients was 61.3 ± 10.4
(22-82) years. ROC curve generated by MPV for OS yielded an AUC of 0.746 (95% CI 
0.659-0.833), (p < 0.001). MPV was detected as >9 fL with a sensitivity of 74.4% 
and a specificity of 72.0%. In patients with stage IIIA, median OS was 45.0
months (95% CI 17.3-74.1) and 21 months (95% CI 10.6-31.3) in groups with
MPV > 9.0 fL and ≤9.0 fL, respectively (p = 0.013). In patients with stage IIIB, 
median OS was 44.0 months (95% CI 13.8-60.6) and 16 months (95% CI 9.5-22.4) in
groups with MPV > 9.0 fL and ≤9.0 fL, respectively (p = 0.036). ECOG performance 
score, total platelet count, and MPV were found as the most significant
independent factors affecting survival (p < 0.001, p = 0.008, and, p = 0.034,
respectively). In this study, we showed that decreased pre-treatment MPV was an
independent risk factor for survival in NSCLC patients who were administered
CCRT. As part of routine complete blood count panel, MPV may represent one of the
easiest measuring tools as an independent prognostic marker for survival in
locally advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung
malignancies and its prognosis is dismal. Although early studies have shown
promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockers, the immune composition
and expression of potentially actionable immunostimulatory targets in this
malignancy are poorly understood.
METHODS: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the
levels of 3 different B7 family ligands PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and major tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue
microarray format. Associations between the marker levels, clinicopathological
variables and survival were studied.
RESULTS: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of 
SCLC cases. The markers showed limited co-expression and were not associated with
the level of TILs, age, gender and stage. Elevated B7-H4 was associated with
shorter 5-year overall survival. The levels of CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TILs and the 
ratio of total/effector T-cells were significantly lower in SCLC than in
non-small cell lung cancer. High levels of CD3+, but not CD8+ or CD20+ TILs were 
significantly associated with longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicate variable expression and clinical 
role of B7-family ligands in SCLC with predominant expression of the candidate
target B7-H3 and the presence of a limited cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. 
These results support the evaluation of B7-H3 blockers and/or pro-inflammatory
therapies in SCLC.

BACKGROUND: CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the
response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and 
small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to
be elucidated.
METHODS: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access
Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5
and then every two cycles until patient's withdrawn from the study. All patients 
underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were
classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured
with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno
radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after
4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over
baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR:
CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS).
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a
disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles
of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was
significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS
(CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1,
p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1
reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The reduction in serum level of CYFRA21-1 or CEA might be a reliable 
biomarker to predict immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients. NSE was not
significant for monitoring the efficacy of nivolumab.

Ubiquitin activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) is a basic component of E1-activating enzyme
in the SUMOylation system. Expression and function of UBA2 in human cancers are
largely unknown. In this study we investigate UBA2 expression the function in
human non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunochemistry study showed that UBA2 was
overexpressed in cancer tissues (53.3%, 40 of 75) compared with normal lung
tissues (14.3%, 4 of 28) (P < 0.05). Immunostaining of UBA2 was mainly detected
in nucleus. Overexpression of UBA2 in cancer tissues was significantly associated
with poor differentiation, large tumor size ( > 5.0 cm), higher T stages
(T3 + 4), lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages (III + IV). In vitro
study showed that UBA2 was expressed in A549, 95D, H1975, and H1299 cells.
Knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation
and upregulated cancer cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cell significantly increased the G1 and G2/M phase
cells and reduced the S phase cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression profile after
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells showed that the most related function was cell
cycle, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Western
blot analysis study showed that knockdown of UBA2 significantly inhibited
expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, mini-chromosome maintenance 7
(MCM7), MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7. These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical
cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this
malignant tumor.

BACKGROUND: Aggressive behavior of tumor metastasis comes from certain mutations,
changes in cellular metabolic and signaling pathways that are majorly altered by 
tumor microenvironment (TME), its other components and growth factors like
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) which is chiefly known for its epithelial 
to mesenchymal transformation (EMT). EMT is a critical step of metastasis cascade
in actual human lung cancer scenario.
OBJECTIVE: Our present study is focused to unveil the in-vivo metastatic behavior
of TGF-β1 treated lung cancer cells that undergone EMT.
METHODS: The lung cancer epithelial A549 cells were treated in-vitro with TGF-β1 
(3-5ng/ml for 72 h) for EMT. After confirming the transformation of cells by
phenotype modifications, wound healing and cell migration assay and qRT-PCR
analyses of EMT biomarkers including E. Cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, MMP2 and
MMP9; those TGF-β1 modified cells were probed with fluorescent trackers and were 
injected into tail vein of BALB/c nude mice for metastatic dissemination studies.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that distribution of TGF-β1 treated A549 cells as 
compared to W.T A549 towards lungs is less in terms of total relative fluorescent
cluster count, however the difference is insignificant (52±4, 60±5 respectively).
Additionally we show that TGF-β1 treated cells tend to metastasize almost 2, 3,
1.5, 2 and 1.7 times more than W.T towards liver, brain, ovaries, bones and
adrenal gland respectively which is very much like human lung cancer metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively it is ever first study reporting that a pre-treatment of
cells with TGF-β1 for experimental lung cancer metastasis mouse model may portray
more precise approach for the development of potential therapeutic treatments.
Additional pre-treatment studies with the application of other TME conditions
like hypoxia and factors like NFκB, VEGF etc. may be a future prospect to develop
a better understanding.

Humans are frequently exposed to acrylamide, a probable human carcinogen found in
commonplace sources such as most heated starchy foods or tobacco smoke. Prior
evidence has shown that acrylamide causes cancer in rodents, yet epidemiological 
studies conducted to date are limited and, thus far, have yielded inconclusive
data on association of human cancers with acrylamide exposure. In this study, we 
experimentally identify a novel and unique mutational signature imprinted by
acrylamide through the effects of its reactive metabolite glycidamide. We next
show that the glycidamide mutational signature is found in a full one-third of
approximately 1600 tumor genomes corresponding to 19 human tumor types from 14
organs. The highest enrichment of the glycidamide signature was observed in the
cancers of the lung (88% of the interrogated tumors), liver (73%), kidney (>70%),
bile duct (57%), cervix (50%), and, to a lesser extent, additional cancer types. 
Overall, our study reveals an unexpectedly extensive contribution of
acrylamide-associated mutagenesis to human cancers.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death due in large
part to our inability to diagnose it at an early and potentially curable stage.
Screening for lung cancer via low dose computed tomographic (LDCT) imaging has
been demonstrated to improve mortality but also results in a high rate of false
positive tests. The identification and application of non-invasive molecular
biomarkers that improve the performance of CT imaging for the detection of lung
cancer in high risk individuals would aid in clinical decision-making, eliminate 
the need for unnecessary LDCT follow-up, and further refine the screening
criteria for an already large high-risk population.
METHODS: The Detection of Early Lung Cancer Among Military Personnel (DECAMP)
consortium is conducting two multicenter prospective studies with the goals of
developing an integrated panel of both airway and blood-based molecular
biomarkers that discriminate benign and malignant indeterminate nodules detected 
on CT scan as well as predict the future development of lung cancer in high-risk 
individuals. To achieve these goals, DECAMP is compiling an extensive array of
biospecimens including nasal brushings, serum, plasma and intrathoracic airway
samples (bronchial brushings and bronchial biopsies) from normal-appearing airway
epithelium.
DISCUSSION: This bank of samples is the foundation for multiple DECAMP efforts
focused on the identification of those at greatest risk of developing lung cancer
as well as the discrimination of benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. The
clinical, imaging and biospecimen repositories will serve as a resource for the
biomedical community and their investigation of the molecular basis of chronic
respiratory disease.

Direct intercellular communication, mediated by gap junctions formed by the
connexin transmembrane protein family, is frequently dysregulated in cancer.
Connexins have been described as tumour suppressors, but emerging evidence
suggests that they can also act as tumour promoters. This feature is connexin-
and tissue-specific and may be mediated by complex signalling pathways through
gap junctions or hemichannels or by completely junction-independent events. Lung 
cancer is the number one cancer in terms of mortality worldwide, and novel
biomarkers and therapeutic targets are urgently needed. Our objective was to gain
a better understanding of connexins in this setting. We used several in silico
tools to analyse TCGA data in order to compare connexin mRNA expression between
healthy lung tissue and lung tumours and correlated these results with gene
methylation patterns. Using Kaplan-Meier plotter tools, we analysed a microarray 
dataset and an RNA-seq dataset of non-small cell lung tumours in order to
correlate connexin expression with patient prognosis. We found that connexin mRNA
expression is frequently either upregulated or downregulated in lung tumours.
This correlated with both good and poor prognosis (overall survival) in a clear
connexin isoform-dependent manner. These associations were strongly influenced by
the histological subtype (adenocarcinoma versus squamous cell carcinoma). We
present an overview of all connexins but particularly focus on four isoforms
implicated in lung cancer: Cx26, Cx30.3, Cx32 and Cx43. We further analysed the
protein expression and localization of Cx43 in a series of 73 human lung tumours.
We identified a subset of tumours that exhibited a unique strong nuclear Cx43
expression pattern that predicted worse overall survival (p = 0.014). Upon
sub-stratification, the prognostic value remained highly significant in the
adenocarcinoma subtype (p = 0.002) but not in the squamous carcinoma subtype (p =
0.578). This finding highlights the importance of analysis of connexin expression
at the protein level, particularly the subcellular localization. Elucidation of
the underlying pathways regulating Cx43 localization may provide for novel
therapeutic opportunities.

To investigate the associations between the functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-125 family and the survival of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we systematically selected six functional SNPs
located in three pre-miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b-1, miR-125b-2). Cox proportional 
hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Reporter gene
luciferase assay was performed to examine the relationship between the SNPs and
transcriptive activity of the miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs in different cells
was detected using quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that rs2241490
(upstream of miR-125b-1, G > A, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.014,
in dominant model; adjusted HR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.03-1.35, P = 0.014, in additive 
model), rs512932 (upstream of miR-125b-1, A > G, dominant model: adjusted
HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.013) and rs8111742 (upstream of miR-125a,
G > A, dominant model: adjusted HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.71-1.00, P = 0.047) were
associated with the prognosis of 1001 Chinese NSCLC patients. The combined
analysis of the three SNPs related the number of risk alleles (rs2241490-A,
rs512932-G and rs8111742-G) to death risk of NSCLC in a locus-dosage mode (P for 
trend <0.001). Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay showed significantly
higher levels of luciferase activity with rs512932 variant G than that with A
allele in 293T, SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines. Besides, miR-125b was highly
expressed in lung cancer cells than the normal lung cell. Our study indicated
that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of
NSCLC patients. Larger population-based and functional studies are needed to
verify these findings.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by
inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the
effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC
gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were
identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical
evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants
with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS)
were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1
Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing
and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366
patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or 
Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set 
(HR adjusted for age, gender, smoking habits, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status, histology, and stage [aHR] and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87,
Cox P=0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 
and 0.36-0.93, Cox P=0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1
gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an
important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC
patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: No definitive biomarker exists for predicting treatment efficacy 
or response to therapy with antibody to programmed cell death-1 (PD1) for
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hence, we investigated
whether the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) predicted anti-PD1 treatment response 
for advanced NSCLC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively identified 47 patients with
NSCLC treated with anti-PD1 and assessed the prognostic value of the GPS. The GPS
was calculated using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations 1 month after 
starting anti-PD1 treatment. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard
models were used to examine differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall
(OS) survival, and clinical response.
RESULTS: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted anti-PD1 treatment
efficacy, as a good post-treatment GPS (GPS 0-1) was significantly associated
with improved PFS. Intra-treatment GPS change was associated with clinical
response.
CONCLUSION: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted efficacy of anti-PD1
treatment for NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Management of advanced stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has
changed significantly over the past two decades with the development of numerous 
systemic treatments, including targeted therapies. However, a high proportion of 
advanced-stage patients are untreated. The role that health insurance plays in
receipt of systemic treatments is unclear.
METHODS: Using California Cancer Registry data (2012-2014), we developed
multivariable Poisson regression models to assess the independent effect of
health insurance type on systemic treatment utilization among stage IV NSCLC
patients. Systemic treatment information was manually abstracted from treatment
text fields.
RESULTS: A total of 17,310 patients were evaluated. Patients with Medicaid/other 
public insurance were significantly less likely to receive any systemic
treatments (risk ratio (RR)=0.78, 95% CI=0.75-0.82), bevacizumab combinations
(RR=0.57, 95% CI=0.45-0.71), or tyrosine kinase inhibitors (RR=0.70, 95%
CI=0.60-0.82) compared to the privately insured. Patients with Medicare or dual
Medicare-Medicaid insurance were not significantly different from the privately
insured in their likelihood of receiving systemic treatments.
CONCLUSIONS: Substantial disparities in the use of systemic treatments for stage 
IV NSCLC exist by source of health insurance in California. Patients with
Medicaid/other public insurance were significantly less likely to receive
systemic treatments compared to their privately insured counterparts.
IMPACT: Source of health insurance influences care received. Further research is 
warranted to better understand barriers to treatment that patients with Medicaid 
face.

BACKGROUND: Cigarette smoking (CS) and betel quid (BQ) chewing are two known risk
factors and have synergistic potential for the development of oral squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC) in Taiwan. The p53 mutation characteristics in OSCC (G to A or G
to T mutations) are similar to that of acrolein-induced DNA damage. Acrolein is a
major cigarette-related carcinogen that preferentially causes p53 mutations and
inhibits DNA repair function in lung cancer. We hypothesize that acrolein is
associated with OSCC carcinogenesis.
METHODS: A total of 97 OSCC patients and 230 healthy subjects with CS and/or BQ
chewing histories were recruited. Slot blot analysis of Acr-dG adducts, an
indicator of acrolein-induced DNA damage in buccal DNA, LC-MS/MS analysis of
3-HPMA levels, urinary Acr metabolites were performed.
RESULTS: Our results showed that the level of Acr-dG adducts in buccal cells was 
1.4-fold higher in OSCC patients than in healthy subjects with CS and/or BQ
chewing histories (p<0.001). Additionally, in healthy subjects, CS and BQ chewing
were associated with significantly higher levels of 3-HPMA, indicating that CS
and BQ chewing promotes acrolein absorption. However, 3-HPMA levels in OSCC
patients were significantly lower than those in healthy subjects, indicating
impaired acrolein metabolism.
CONCLUSIONS: In this study, we provide a novel mechanism by which increased
acrolein uptake and impaired metabolism may contribute to the synergistic
potential of cigarette and betel quid-induced OSCC.
IMPACT: Elevated acrolein-induced DNA damage (Acr-dG adducts) detected in buccal 
swabs may serve as an early indicator to identify patients at risk of developing 
OSCC.

BACKGROUND: Exposure to ambient airborne particulate matter is a major risk
factor for mortality and morbidity, associated with asthma, lung cancer, heart
disease, myocardial infarction, and stroke, and more recently type 2 diabetes,
dementia and loss of cognitive function. Less is understood about differential
effects of particulate matter from different sources. Underground railways are
used by millions of people on a daily basis in many cities. Poor air exchange
with the outside environment means that underground railways often have an
unusually high concentration of airborne particulate matter, while a high degree 
of railway-associated mechanical activity produces particulate matter which is
physicochemically highly distinct from ambient particulate matter. The
implications of this for the health of exposed commuters and employees is
unclear.
MAIN BODY: A literature search found 27 publications directly assessing the
potential health effects of underground particulate matter, including in vivo
exposure studies, in vitro toxicology studies, and studies of particulate matter 
which might be similar to that found in underground railways. The methodology,
findings, and conclusions of these studies were reviewed in depth, along with
further publications directly relevant to the initial search results. In vitro
studies suggest that underground particulate matter may be more toxic than
exposure to ambient/urban particulate matter, especially in terms of endpoints
related to reactive oxygen species generation and oxidative stress. This appears 
to be predominantly a result of the metal-rich nature of underground particulate 
matter, which is suggestive of increased health risks. However, while there are
measureable effects on a variety of endpoints following exposure in vivo, there
is a lack of evidence for these effects being clinically significant as may be
implied by the in vitro evidence.
CONCLUSION: There is little direct evidence that underground railway particulate 
matter exposure is more harmful than ambient particulate matter exposure. This
may be due to disparities between in vivo exposures and in vitro models, and
differences in exposure doses, as well as statistical under powering of in vivo
studies of chronic exposure. Future research should focus on outcomes of chronic 
in vivo exposure, as well as further work to understand mechanisms and potential 
biomarkers of exposure.

Formenti et al. have recently reported the clinical outcomes and translational
readouts of a trial of the anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, in combination with
palliative radiotherapy in 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A
radiological response was seen in 18% of patients and 31% of patients experienced
disease control. These clinical outcomes appear to be superior to historical
studies using ipilimumab alone and suggest that radiation may have triggered
systemic, so-called abscopal, immune responses in some patients. Induction of
interferon-beta (IFN-β) and maximal expansion and contraction of distinct T cell 
receptor clones were the most significant factors predicting response.
Importantly, established predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy
alone, including the expression of PD-L1 in diagnostic biopsies and tumour
mutational burden, did not predict response. The report provides important human 
qualification of pre-clinical mechanistic insights indicating that abscopal
responses can be generated with optimised radiotherapy fractionation schedules
and anti-CTLA-4 inhibition. Additionally, an intriguing mechanism by which
radiation can be immunogenic is described, namely radiation-induced
transcriptional upregulation of neo-antigens.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastases (BM) are the most frequent intracranial malignant
tumor. Various prognostic factors facilitate the prediction of survival; however,
few have become tools for clinical use.
PURPOSE: To investigate the role of three-dimensional (3D) quantitative tissue
enhancement in pre-treatment cranial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a
radiomic biomarker for survival (OS) in patients with singular BM treated with
stereotactic radiation therapy (SRT).
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this retrospective study, 48 patients (27 non-small cell
lung cancer and 21 melanoma) with singular BM treated with SRT, were analyzed.
Contrast-enhanced MRI scans of the neurocranium were used for quantitative image 
analyses. Segmentation-based 3D quantification was performed to measure the
enhancing tumor volume. A cut-off value of 68.61% of enhancing volume was used to
stratify the cohort into two groups (≤68.61% and > 68.61%). Univariable and
multivariable cox regressions were used to analyze the prognostic factors of OS
and intracranial progression-free survival (iPFS).
RESULTS: The level of enhancing tumor volume achieved statistical significance in
univariable and multivariable analysis for OS (univariable: P = 0.005, hazard
ratio [HR] = 0.375, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.168-0.744; multivariable:
P = 0.006, HR = 0.376, 95% CI = 0.186-0.757). Patients with high-level
enhancement (>68.61% enhancing lesion volume) survived significantly longer (4.9 
vs. 10.2 months) and showed significantly longer iPFS rates (univariable:
P < 0.001, HR = 0.046, 95% CI = 0.009-0.245).
CONCLUSIONS: Patients with lesions that show a higher percentage of enhancement
in pre-treatment MRI demonstrated improved iPFS and OS compared to those with
mainly hypo-enhancing lesions. Lesion enhancement may be a radiomic marker,
useful in prognostic indices for survival prediction, in patients with singular
BM.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and the current 
therapy seems to have reached a plateau due to toxicities and acquired
resistance. Therefore, exploration of novel therapeutic avenues may be useful. Si
Jun Zi Tang (SJZ), a four-herb Chinese medicine formula first described
approximately one thousand years, is often prescribed for cancer patients as a
complementary therapy. However, whether SJZ benefits cancer patients as well as
the main active constituents and its regulatory mechanism in combination with
anticancer drugs remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anti-lung cancer
potency and underlying mechanisms of the combination of gefitinib plus SJZ in
mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), using histopathology and an integrated
strategy of metabolomics and network pharmacology. The results showed that SJZ
significantly enhanced gefitinib suppressing tumor growth and inhibiting LLC
metastasis in LLC-bearing mice. Furthermore, 9 potential metabolomics biomarkers 
that differentially expressed in the SJZ/gefitinib group compared to the SJZ
group or gefitinib group were identified by untargeted metabolomics, mainly
involved three pathways: tricarboxylic acid cycle, tyrosine and tryptophan
biosynthesis metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism. Five active ingredients,
kaempferol, ginsenoside Rf, caprylic acid, lauric acid and naringenin, acted
directly on 9 targets and regulated 4 out of 9 metabolites. Our results indicated
that SJZ enhanced the anti-lung cancer effects of gefitinib via the key targets

Pemetrexed (MTA) is a folate antimetabolite used for treating non-small cell lung
cancer. To elucidate the mechanisms of pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer, we
established pemetrexed-resistant sublines in PC9 (mutant EGFR) and H1993
(wild-type EGFR) lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC9-MTA, H1993-MTA). Gene
expression profile comparison by microarray analyses revealed enhanced fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, confirmed by
Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ERK phosphorylation was increased in
PC9-MTA but decreased in H1993-MTA along with decreased downstream signaling
molecule phosphorylation. Cellular morphological change from epithelial to
spindle-shape together with increased mesenchymal marker protein expression was
observed in H1993-MTA. SiRNA-mediated FGF2 knockdown partially restored
pemetrexed sensitivity in both lines, whereas anti-FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074
restored pemetrexed sensitivity in PC9-MTA. FGF2 or FGFR1 inhibition decreased
pERK levels in PC9-MTA but increased pEGFR levels together with downstream
signaling molecule activation and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition
marker protein expression in H1993-MTA. Although thymidylate synthase strongly
facilitates the development of pemetrexed resistance, our results reveal
involvement of the FGF2-FGFR1 pathway in pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer
cells and suggest that cellular function alterations induced by FGF2-FGFR1
pathway activation depend on the innate feature of cancer cells.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas (PSC) are a rare group of lung cancer with a
median overall survival of 9-12 months. PSC are divided into five histotypes,
challenging to diagnose and treat. The identification of PSC biomarkers is
warranted, but PSC molecular profile remains to be defined. Herein, a targeted
whole transcriptome analysis was performed on 14 PSC samples, evaluated also for 
the presence of the main oncogene mutations and rearrangements. PSC expression
data were compared with transcriptome data of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and
squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Deregulated genes
were used for pathway enrichment analysis; the most representative genes were
tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent cohort (30 PSC, 31 LUAD,
31 LUSC). All PSC cases were investigated for PD-L1 expression. Thirty-eight
genes deregulated in PSC were identified, among these IGJ and SLMAP were
confirmed by IHC. Moreover, Forkhead box signaling and Fanconi anemia pathways
were specifically enriched in PSC. Finally, some PSC harboured alterations in
genes targetable by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as EGFR and MET. We provide a
deep molecular characterization of PSC; the identification of specific molecular 
profiles, besides increasing our knowledge on PSC biology, might suggest new
strategies to improve patients management.

Background: Primary malignant mediastinal germ cell tumors (PMMGCTs) including
seminomas and nonseminomatous germ cell tumors (NSGCTs) are rare, and sometimes
the diagnosis is very difficult.
Purpose: The purpose of this study is to compare the clinical characteristics,
biomarkers, and imaging findings of seminomas and NSGCTs and to determine whether
these features could help distinguish these two types of PMMGCT.
Material and Methods: A retrospective study of 24 male patients with
histopathologically proven PMMGCT was performed. We collected the information of 
computed tomography (CT) (the scan area ranged from the apex of lung to the
costophrenic angles) and magnetic resonance imaging blood test and histology
characteristics of these patients.
Results: Twelve of 24 cases were confirmed to be seminomas, whereas the other 12 
cases were NSGCTs. Alfa-fetoprotein (AFP) was found to be elevated in all
patients with NSGCT, whereas none of the patients with seminomas had elevated AFP
level. Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-HCG) level was elevated in all the
patients with seminomas (seven/seven), whereas in NSGCT only two of seven
patients had elevated β-HCG. Lactate dehydrogenase level was increased in five of
the nine patients with seminomas, as well as in the eight patients with NSGCT. CT
imaging revealed that 12 masses from the seminoma group were homogeneous, soft
tissue opacity and showed minimal contrast enhancement. On the contrary, all 12
NSGCT cases showed cystic and solid masses; on contrast-enhanced CT,
heterogeneous enhancement was found on the capsule of the tumor, septum, and
solid masses.
Conclusion: Seminomas and NSGCT showed different profiles of tumor biomarkers and
radiographic features. Evidence from serum test, histopathological analysis, and 
imaging should be combined to ensure the accurate diagnosis of these two types of
PMMGCT.

Gustave Roussy Immune Score Is a Prognostic Factor for Chemotherapy-Naive
Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma With Wild-Type Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

Minami S(1), Ihara S(1), Komuta K(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Respiratory Medicine, Osaka Police Hospital, Osaka 543-0035,
Japan.

Background: The Gustave Roussy Immune Score (GRIm-Score) was developed based on
the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score for the purpose of a better
patient selection for immunotherapy phase I trials. This scoring system is simply
calculated by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
serum albumin concentration. The aim of our study was to determine whether
GRIm-Score is a practically useful prognostic biomarker for advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or
epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
Methods: This retrospective and single institutional study collected 185
adenocarcinomas without active EGFR mutation, 115 squamous cell carcinomas
treated with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 140 NSCLCs with mutant EGFR
treated with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy. These treatments
were initiated between July 2007 and March 2018 at our hospital. We compared
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low
GRIm-Score groups. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we also
found prognostic factors of survival times.
Results: The OS and PFS of low GRIm-Score group were significantly longer than
those of high-score group in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (low vs. high; median 
OS, 18.4 vs. 5.1 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 5.8 vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.01) 
and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (median OS, 38.9 vs. 10.4 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS,
15.9 vs. 5.0 months, P < 0.01). Subsequent multivariate analyses detected high
GRIm-Score in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma as a poor prognostic factor of OS
(hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.47 - 3.31, P < 0.01), and in the EGFR-mutant
NSCLC as a poor prognostic factor of PFS (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00 - 3.55, P =
0.049).
Conclusions: High GRIm-Score was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS of
first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma and of PFS of
first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Therefore, GRIm-Score
is not only a specific selection marker for experimental immunotherapy trials,
but may also be a promising and useful pretreatment prognostic maker for specific
NSCLC subsets in the real-world practice.

Pretreatment Lung Immune Prognostic Index Is a Prognostic Marker of Chemotherapy 
and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Respiratory Medicine, Osaka Police Hospital, 10-31 Kitayama-cho,

Background: Lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) was recently developed on the
basis of the combination of baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio
(dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This index was demonstrated as a specific
biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We aimed to show that LIPI may be a useful biomarker of cytotoxic chemotherapy
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for
NSCLC.
Methods: We retrospectively collected 175 wild-type EGFR adenocarcinomas, 131
NSCLCs harboring mutant EGFR and 110 squamous cell carcinomas. All patients
initiated first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI monotherapy between July 
2007 and August 2017 at our hospital. These patients were divided into good,
intermediate and poor LIPI groups. We compared their overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analyses detected prognostic and
predictive factors of OS and PFS.
Results: The good LIPI group survived longer than the intermediate and poor LIPI 
groups in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups:
median 19.6, 11.5 and 3.3 months, P < 0.01, respectively) and mutant EGFR NSCLC
(45.4, 25.6 and 15.7 months, P < 0.01). The PFS of good LIPI group was
significantly longer that those of the other two groups in mutant EGFR NSCLC
(16.6, 12.6 and 8.3 months, P < 0.01). The intermediate group (hazard ratio (HR) 
1.49, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.15, P = 0.04) of wild-type EGFR
adenocarcinoma, intermediate (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 - 3.99, P < 0.01) and poor (HR
2.76, 95% CI 1.03 - 7.42, P = 0.04) groups of mutant EGFR NSCLC were independent 
prognostic factors of poor OS. The intermediate (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.44, P =
0.04) and poor (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.14 - 6.07, P = 0.02) groups were significant
prognostic factors of PFS of mutant EGFR NSCLC.
Conclusions: LIPI was an independent prognostic factor of chemotherapy for
adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR and of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC harboring mutant
EGFR. Thus, LIPI was not a specific biomarker for ICI therapy, but a useful
biomarker for chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI therapy in specific subsets of NSCLC.

In lung cancer, antiangiogenic strategies targeting tumor-derived endothelial
cells (TECs) afford a survival advantage, but the characteristics of TECs have
not been comprehensively elucidated. Herein, high-purity (> 98%) TECs were
obtained, and these cells retained expression of EC markers and exhibited high
viability. ITRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS was performed to profile the proteome and the
heterogeneity of ECs. Only 31 of 1820 identified proteins were differentially
expressed between adenocarcinoma (ADC)- and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-derived
TECs (TEC-A and TEC-S, respectively), and cadherin-2 (CDH2) was the most
significantly upregulated protein in TEC-A samples. Positive immunostaining for
CDH2 (score > 3) was significantly more frequent in the endothelium of ADC
tissues than in that of SCC tissues. Loss- or gain-of-function analysis showed
that CDH2 significantly promoted in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and
sensitivity to the antagonist exherin. The MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNK signaling
pathways may play crucial roles in CDH2-induced HIF-1α/VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis. Moreover, high CDH2 expression in TECs was significantly associated
with tumor stage, visceral pleural metastasis, and decreased overall survival in 
patients with ADC but not SCC. Together, these data indicate the importance of
CDH2 in angiogenesis and highlight its potential both for antiangiogenic therapy 
and as a candidate prognostic marker for ADC.

Role of preoperative blood markers as prognostic factors for lung cancer surgery.

Hamid UI(1), Al-Saudi R(1), Paul I(1), Graham A(1).

Author information: 
(1)Department of Cardiothoracic surgery, Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast, UK.

OBJECTIVE: This study was undertaken to assess the potential value of
preoperative blood components as prognostic markers of outcome after lung cancer 
resection, and hence their potential to aid in the selection of patients for
curative surgery.
METHODS: This was a single-center study on 313 patients who underwent surgery for
non-small-cell lung cancer from 2006 to 2008. Data were analyzed retrospectively 
from a prospectively maintained thoracic database. Preoperative blood results
including plasma fibrinogen levels, serum C-reactive protein, hemoglobin
concentration, and platelet count were included in the analysis.
RESULTS: The mean age was 75 years, and 40% of the patients were females. The
most common resection was lobectomy in 68% of patients, followed by
pneumonectomy, wedge resection, and segmentectomy in 18%, 10%, and 1.6%,
respectively. Patients with abnormal C-reactive protein, fibrinogen, and
hemoglobin levels had a worse overall survival. Large tumor size and nodal
metastasis on clinical staging was also associated with poor survival. However,
on Cox regression analysis, plasma fibrinogen and nodal metastasis were the only 
independent predictors of survival after lung resection.
CONCLUSIONS: Among the different blood markers, elevated preoperative plasma
fibrinogen was an independent marker of reduced survival in patients with
resected non-small-cell lung cancer, and its value in selecting patients who may 
benefit from surgery needs further investigation.

Breath collection and analysis can be used to discover volatile biomarkers in a
number of infectious and non-infectious diseases, such as malaria, tuberculosis, 
lung cancer, and liver disease. This protocol describes a reproducible method for
sampling breath in children and then stabilizing breath samples for further
analysis with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The goal of this
method is to establish a standardized protocol for the acquisition of breath
samples for further chemical analysis, from children aged 4-15 years. First,
breath is sampled using a cardboard mouthpiece attached to a 2-way valve, which
is connected to a 3 L bag. Breath analytes are then transferred to a thermal
desorption tube and stored at 4-5 °C until analysis. This technique has been
previously used to capture breath of children with malaria for successful breath 
biomarker identification. Subsequently, we have successfully applied this
technique to additional pediatric cohorts. The advantage of this method is that
it requires minimal cooperation on part of the patient (of particular value in
pediatric populations), has a short collection period, does not require trained
staff, and can be performed with portable equipment in resource-limited field
settings.

Most cancer diagnoses rely on biomarkers detection. This could be improved if
directly conducted in suspicious cancer spots, preventing the need for biopsy.
Lung cancer remains a perfect study-case for such a development, as it is
generally detected at advanced stage and is in the need for early diagnosis
techniques. To this aim, we have designed a minimally invasive catheter-embedded 
biosensor. It combines a specific grating structure photo-imprinted in a
telecommunication-grade optical fiber and an overlay made of a thin metal coating
on which receptors are grafted, yielding plasmonic coupling. Our optrode targets 
a type of cytokeratins, overexpressed at the surface of cancer cells. It was
assayed ex vivo in resected lung tissues collected from a dozen of patients.
Biosensing responses were confirmed by immunohistochemistry, conducted on the
same samples. In addition to accurate biosensing, our gratings inherently enable 
force-sensing features, which also allow a fine positioning of the probe in the
tissue. Finally, the in vivo navigation of the bronchoscope-embedded sensor was
validated into pig lungs. These achievements are a critical milestone towards the
development of this micro/nano biosensor as a cost-effective and weakly invasive 
diagnostic tool for applications in areas of critical access such as brain, liver
or prostate.

Treatment of advanced-stage or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, which can now be treated with
molecularly targeted therapies, had been based on cytotoxic chemotherapy for a
long time. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed
against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have
transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the
reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their
efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was
validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab,
atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with
chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III 
trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in
combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation
burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most
from first-line ICI use.

OBJECTIVE: The abnormal expression of the key enzymes in glycolytic pathways,
including glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-3, hexokinase-II, lactate
dehydrogenase 5, pyruvate kinase M2, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
transketolase-like protein 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 was reported to 
be associated with poor prognosis of various cancers. However, the association
remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the
prognostic significance of glycolysis-related proteins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using Pubmed 
and Ovid as search engines and Google Scholar from inception to April 2017.
Eighty-six studies with 12,002 patients were included in the study.
RESULTS: Our pooled results identified that glycolysis-related proteins in
cancers were associated with shorter overall survival of colorectal cancer (HR
2.33, 95% CI 1.38-3.93, P = 0.002), gastric cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.82,
P < 0.001), cancer of gallbladder or bile duct (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70-2.75,
P < 0.001), oral cancer (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.25, P < 0.001), esophageal cancer
(HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25-2.21, P = 0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 2.04, 95% CI 
1.64-2.54, P < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.39-2.13, P < 0.001), 
breast cancer(HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08, P < 0.001), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.75-7.36, P < 0.001). No association was found for lung cancer,
ovarian cancer or melanoma. The key glycolytic transcriptional regulators
(HIF-1α, p53) were analyzed in parallel to the glycolysis-related proteins, and
the pooled results identified that high-level expression of HIF-1α was
significantly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI
0.42-0.79, P < 0.001) Furthermore, glycolysis-related proteins linked with poor
differentiated tumors (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46-2.25, P < 0.001), positive lymph node
metastasis (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.16-3.46, P < 0.001), positive vascular invasion (OR
2.05, 95% CI 1.37-3.07, P < 0.001), large tumor size (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.80-2.37, 
P < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19-2.09, P < 0.001), and
deeper invasion (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.93-2.91, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Glycolytic transcriptional regulators and glycolysis-related proteins
in cancers were significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting
glycolytic status may be potentially valuable prognostic biomarkers for various
cancers.

Early elevation of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, or CRP, which
is a surrogate marker for IL-6, following commencement of PD-1/L1 inhibitors
(PD1-I) may represent early activation of immune-cells. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were
measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 
7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were
reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the
treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum
levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and
post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453;
TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four
responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response 
rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased
after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably,
in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6
or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median
overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in
the non-elevated group (p = 0.069). The early increase in inflammatory cytokines 
with PD1-I was indicated to be predictive for the efficacy in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer.

Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), have been
linked to higher tumor mutation burden and improved response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. However, the significance of MMR mutations in lung cancer has not
been well characterized, and the relevance of other processes, including
homologous recombination (HR) and polymerase epsilon (POLE) activity, remains
unclear. Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from
The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with
increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with
greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA
repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of
TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and
DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high
neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic
activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair 
pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific
immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as
biomarkers for immunotherapy.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly inhibitors of the PD-1 axis,
have altered the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the last
ten years. First demonstrated to improve outcomes in second-line or later therapy
of advanced disease, ICIs were shown to improve overall survival (OS) compared to
chemotherapy in first line therapy for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 on at 
least 50% of cells. More recently, combining ICIs with chemotherapy has been
shown to improve survival in patients with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC,
regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 and, more recently, tumor
mutational burden (TMB) have not proven to be straightforward indicative
biomarkers. We describe the advances to date in utilizing these biomarkers, as
well as novel markers of tumor inflammation, to ascertain which patients are most
likely to benefit from ICIs. Ongoing translational work promises to improve the
proportion of patients who benefit from these agents.

Aim: Spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase (SSAT-1) plays a critical role in
cell growth, proliferation and death, and is known to be activated in human
cancer cells. Amantadine, a US FDA-approved antiviral drug, is a substrate for
SSAT-1 and can be used to indirectly measure SSAT-1 activity because of its
conversion to acetylamantadine (AA). This study was undertaken to further
validate SSAT-1 activity in breast and lung cancer patients.
Results: An increase in the urinary concentration of AA in lung and breast cancer
patients was observed. The 0-2 h collection time point was determined to be
optimal in revealing significant differences in urinary AA concentration between 
healthy controls and cancer patients.
Conclusion: The high urine concentration of AA could be used as a simple and
useful test for the detection of breast and lung cancer.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most
promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies
that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy,
ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by
the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis
leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has
been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 
have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers,
including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful
ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy
significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival 
with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for
advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical
applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and
acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and
treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest
clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide,
as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this
therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the
application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in 
cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed
cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment
of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical
applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population 
with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses
the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate
guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the
criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies,
and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination
therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.

PURPOSE: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of a mixture of indigo carmine and
lipiodol (MIL) as a marker of pulmonary nodule before video-assisted thoracic
surgery (VATS).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight sessions of pulmonary marking were
performed using MIL before VATS for 184 nodules (mean size, 1.2 ± 0.6 cm; range, 
0.3-3.6 cm) on 157 patients (83 men and 74 women; median age, 66 years). The mean
distance between the lung surface and the nodule was 0.8 ± 0.7 cm (range, 0-3.9
cm). MIL was injected near the nodule using a 23-gauge needle. Mean number of 1.2
± 0.4 (range, 1-3) punctures were performed in a session for the target nodules, 
with mean number of 1.1 ± 0.3 (range, 1-3). Successful targeting, localization,
and VATS were defined as achievement of lipiodol accumulation at the target site 
on computed tomography, detection of the nodule in the operative field by
fluoroscopy or visualization of dye pigmentation, and complete resection of the
target nodule with sufficient margin, respectively.
RESULTS: The successful targeting rate was 100%, and the successful localization 
rate was 99.5%, with dye pigmentation for 160 nodules (87.0%) and intraoperative 
fluoroscopy for 23 nodules (12.5%). Successful VATS was achieved for 181 nodules 
(98.4%). Two nodules (1.1%) were not resectable, and surgical margin was positive
in 1 nodule (0.5%). Complications requiring interventions occurred in 5 sessions 
(3.0%) and included pneumothorax with chest tube placement (n = 3) and aspiration
(n = 2). No complication related to the injected MIL occurred.
CONCLUSIONS: MIL was safe and useful for preoperative pulmonary nodule marking.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis remains the biggest obstacle for breast cancer treatment. 
Therefore, identification of specific biomarker of metastasis is very necessary. 
The RNA binding protein 3 (RBMS3) acts as a tumor suppressor in various cancers. 
Whereas, its role and underlying molecular mechanism in breast cancer is far from
elucidated.
METHODS: Quantitative real-time PCR and western blots were carried out to
determine the expression of RBMS3 in breast cancer cells and tissues. Transwell
and in vivo metastasis assay were conducted to investigate the effects of RBMS3
on migration, invasion and metastasis of breast cancer cells. Transcriptome
sequencing was applied to screen out the differential gene expression affected by
RBMS3. RNA immunoprecipitation assay combined with luciferase reporter assay were
performed to explore the direct correlation between RBMS3 and Twist1 mRNA.
RESULTS: RBMS3 was downregulated in breast cancer and ectopic expression of RBMS3
contributed to inhibition of cell migration, invasion in vitro and lung
metastasis in vivo. Furthermore, RBMS3 negatively regulated Twsit1 expression via
directly binding to 3'-UTR of Twist1 mRNA, and thereby decreased Twist1-induced
expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2). Additionally, Twist1-induced
cell migration, invasion and lung metastasis could be reversed by the
upregulation of RBMS3.
CONCLUSIONS: In summary, our study revealed a novel mechanism of the
RBMS3/Twsit1/MMP2 axis in the regulation of invasion and metastasis of breast
cancer, which may become a potential molecular marker for breast cancer
treatment.

BACKGROUND: HOTTIP, a long non-coding RNA located in the HOXA cluster, plays a
role in the patterning of tissues with mesodermal components, including the lung.
Overexpression of HOXA genes, including HOTTIP, has been associated with a more
aggressive phenotype in several cancers. However, the prognostic impact of HOTTIP
has not yet been explored in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have
correlated HOTTIP expression with time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS)
in early-stage NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Ninety-nine early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection 
in our center from June 2007 to November 2013 were included in the study. Mean
age was 66; 77.8% were males; 73.7% had stage I disease; and 55.5% had
adenocarcinoma. A validation data set comprised stage I-II patients from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network.
RESULTS: HOTTIP was expressed in all tumor samples and was overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.007) and in smokers (p = 0.018). Patients with
high levels of HOTTIP had shorter TTR (78.3 vs 58 months; p = 0.048) and shorter 
OS (81.2 vs 61 months; p = 0.023) than those with low levels. In the multivariate
analysis, HOTTIP emerged as an independent prognostic marker for TTR (OR: 2.05,
95%CI: 1-4.2; p = 0.05), and for OS (OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.04-5.1; p = 0.04). HOTTIP
was validated as a prognostic marker for OS in the TCGA adenocarcinoma cohort
(p = 0.025). Moreover, we identified a 1203-mRNA and a 61-miRNA signature that
correlated with HOTTIP expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The lncRNA HOTTIP can be considered a prognostic biomarker in
early-stage NSCLC.

As targeted molecular therapies and immuno-oncology have become pivotal in the
management of patients with lung cancer, the essential requirement for high
throughput analyses and clinical validation of biomarkers has become even more
intense, with response rates maintained in the 20%⁻30% range. Moreover, the list 
of treatment alternatives, including combination therapies, is rapidly evolving. 
The molecular profiling and specific tumor-associated immune contexture may be
predictive of response or resistance to these therapeutic strategies. Multiplexed
immunohistochemistry is an effective and proficient approach to simultaneously
identify specific proteins or molecular abnormalities, to determine the spatial
distribution and activation state of immune cells, as well as the presence of
immunoactive molecular expression. This method is highly advantageous for
investigating immune evasion mechanisms and discovering potential biomarkers to
assess mechanisms of action and to predict response to a given treatment. This
review provides views on the current technological status and evidence for
clinical applications of multiplexing and how it could be applied to optimize
clinical management of patients with lung cancer.

Lung cancer is a complex disease involving multiple genetic and phenotypic
alterations. As a histone modification enzyme, protein‑arginine deiminase type‑4 
(PADI4) and its downstream signaling have been studied in the progression of a
variety of types of human cancer, but data on PADI4‑mediated posttranslational
modification in lung cancer are lacking. The aim of present study was to evaluate
the expression of PADI4 and its associated molecular signaling in lung cancer
metastasis. The results of the present study indicated that PADI4 was
overexpressed in lung cancer cells, while knockdown of PADI4 could lead to
attenuation of the lung cancer cell invasion and migration phenotype, which was
further verified by determining the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)
marker proteins. Additionally, it was demonstrated that stable knockdown of PADI4
in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a striking reduction of the EMT‑associated 
Snail1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3/4 transcriptional complex, which
was consistent with alterations in migratory and invasive phenotypes of A549 lung
cancer cells. Therefore, PADI4‑mediated EMT transition is proposed to represent a
novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic and phenotypic alterations in lung
cancer cells, and the PADI4 associated signaling pathway may be a therapeutic
target for treating lung cancer in a clinical setting.

Ehm2 [also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1‑like protein 4B
(EPB41L4B)] is a member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. The overexpression of
Ehm2 has been observed in metastatic cancer cells. Through alternative splicing, 
the Ehm2 gene produces two transcript variants that encode the two different
isoforms, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2. The biological functions of these different Ehm2
transcript variants remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the
expression of the Ehm2 variants in lung adenocarcinoma and their involvement in
the disease progression of the patients. The expression of Ehm2 transcript
variants in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues was analyzed using
immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Ehm2 variants were overexpressed 
or knocked down in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The consequent effects
of the genetic modifications on the cellular functions of lung cancer cells were 
then examined using in vitro cell viability, invasion and migration assays. The
expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related markers was
evaluated by western blot analysis in the cell models. The association of Ehm2
variant expression with patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis. The expression of Ehm2/1 was significantly decreased in lung cancers
compared with the paired normal lung tissues (P<0.05), while the Ehm2/2 protein
levels were higher in the tumors than in the paired normal lung tissues, although
this was not statistically significant. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 exerted
inhibitory effects, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 promoted the growth, invasion
and migration of A549 cells in vitro. Ehm2/2 was expressed at low levels in the
A549 cells and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 significantly increased the
invasiveness and migration of the A549 cells. Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that Ehm2/1 was confined to the plasma membrane, while Ehm2/2 was
observed at both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 
resulted in the upregulation of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin, and in the
decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, N‑cadherin and Snail1, while the
knockdown of Ehm2/1 and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 had the opposite
effects on the protein levels of EMT‑related markers. Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis revealed that higher Ehm2/1 transcript levels were associated with the
longer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, while the lower expression 
of Ehm2/2 exhibited a similar association with patient survival. Taken together, 
the two Ehm2 variants appear to be differentially expressed in lung
adenocarcinoma. Ehm2/1 may function as a putative tumor suppressor in the disease
progression of lung adenocarcinoma, while Ehm2/2 may have an opposite function.

BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on lung cancer cells is 
a prognostic marker and a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
However, previous clinical trials have suggested that other programmed cell death
1 ligands, including programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), might have clinical
impacts. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic significance of PD-L2
expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
METHODS: The study included 433 patients who underwent surgical resection for
lung adenocarcinoma between 2003 and 2012 at Kyushu University Hospital. Both
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The cutoff
value for PD-L2 positivity was set at 1% according to a time-dependent receiver
operating characteristic curve for 5-year survival.
RESULTS: Of the 433 patients, 306 (70.7%) were positive for PD-L2. No significant
association between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was observed (P = 0.094). The
multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of PD-L2 positivity 
were never-smoker status (P = 0.002), poor differentiation grade (P = 0.008), and
advanced stage (P = 0.048). The PD-L2-positive patients had significantly shorter
disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.018) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016).
Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 positivity were independent predictors of OS (P < 0.001 and 
P = 0.027, respectively). In the subgroup analysis of the PD-L1-negative
patients, PD-L2 positivity was significantly associated with shorter DFS
(P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of patients
with PD-L1 expression may differ from those of patients with PD-L2 expression,
and that both might contribute to poor prognoses. The potential role of PD-L2
expression as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy should be
investigated in future studies.

Type III epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been previously associated
with increased cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and therefore cancer
aggressiveness. This reversible process is associated with an important gene
expression reprogramming mainly due to epigenetic plasticity. Nevertheless, most 
of the studies describing the central role of epigenetic modifications during EMT
were performed in a single-cell model and using only one mode of EMT induction.
In our study, we studied the overall modulations of gene expression and
epigenetic modifications in four different EMT-induced cell models issued from
different tissues and using different inducers of EMT. Pangenomic analysis
(transcriptome and ChIP-sequencing) validated our hypothesis that gene expression
reprogramming during EMT is largely regulated by epigenetic modifications of a
wide range of genes. Indeed, our results confirmed that each EMT model is unique 
and can be associated with a specific transcriptome profile and epigenetic
program. However, we could select some genes or pathways that are similarly
regulated in the different models and that could therefore be used as a common
signature of all EMT models and become new biomarkers of the EMT phenotype. As an
example, we can cite the regulation of gene-coding proteins involved in the
degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which are highly induced in all
EMT models. Based on our investigations and results, we identified ADAM19 as a
new biomarker of in vitro and in vivo EMT and we validated this biological new
marker in a cohort of non-small lung carcinomas.

Tumor metastasis is a hallmark of cancer, with distant metastasis frequently
developing in lung cancer, even at initial diagnosis, resulting in poor prognosis
and high mortality. However, available biomarkers cannot reliably predict cancer 
spreading sites. The metastatic cascade involves highly complicated processes
including invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition that are tightly controlled by various genetic expression modalities
along with interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix. In
particular, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, can influence
the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, with dysregulation of
miRNA expression contributing to the regulation of cancer metastasis.
Nevertheless, although miRNA-targeted therapy is widely studied in vitro and in
vivo, this strategy currently affords limited feasibility and a few
miRNA-targeted therapies for lung cancer have entered into clinical trials to
date. Advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of metastasis will thus
provide additional potential targets for lung cancer treatment. This review
discusses the current research related to the role of miRNAs in lung cancer
invasion and metastasis, with a particular focus on the different metastatic
lesions and potential miRNA-targeted treatments for lung cancer with the
expectation that further exploration of miRNA-targeted therapy may establish a
new spectrum of lung cancer treatments.

The understanding of the natural history and biology of lung cancer has been
enhanced by studies into circulating tumor cells (CTCs). Fundamental and
translational research, as well as clinical trials in the characterization and
behavior of these cells, have constantly contributed to improving understanding
within the domain of thoracic oncology. However, the use of these CTCs as
prognostic and predictive biomarkers has not been adopted to the same extent as
circulating free DNA (cf-DNA) in plasma, in the daily practice of thoracic
oncologists. However, recent technological advances have firmly put the detection
and characterization of CTCs in thoracic oncology back on the agenda, and have
opened up perspectives for their routine clinical use. This review discusses the 
major advances of using CTCs in the domain of thoracic oncology, as well as the
envisaged short- and long-term prospects.

BACKGROUND: ING5 is the last member of the Inhibitor of Growth (ING) candidate
tumor suppressor family that has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, 
including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. Our
previous study showed that ING5 overexpression inhibits lung cancer
aggressiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with unknown
mechanisms.
METHODS: Western blotting was used to detect total and phosphorylated levels of
β-catenin and EMT-related proteins. Immunofluorescent staining was used to
observe E-cadherin expression. Proliferation and colony formation, wound healing,
and Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to study the
proliferative and invasive abilities of cancer cells.
RESULTS: ING5 overexpression promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37,
leading to a decreased β-catenin protein level. Small hairpin RNA-mediated ING5
knockdown significantly increased the β-catenin level and inhibited
phosphorylation of β-catenin S33/37. Treatment with the WNT/β-catenin inhibitor
XAV939 inhibited ING5-knockdown promoted proliferation, colony formation,
migration, and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells, with increased phosphorylation
of β-catenin S33/37 and a decreased β-catenin level. XAV939 also impaired
ING5-knockdown-induced EMT, as indicated by upregulated expression of the EMT
marker E-cadherin, an epithelial marker; and decreased expression of N-cadherin, 
a mesenchymal marker, and EMT-related transcription factors, including Snail,
Slug, Twist, and Smad3. Furthermore, XAV939 could inhibit the activation of both 
IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: ING5 inhibits lung cancer invasion and EMT by inhibiting the
WNT/β-catenin pathway.

cells undergo phenotype transition and differentiate into motile, invasive cells,
has been indicated in tumor metastasis. The melatonin hormone secreted by the
pineal gland has an antioxidant effect and protects cells against carcinogenic
substances that reduce tumor progression. However, the effects of melatonin in
EMT and lung cancer metastasis are largely unknown. We found that melatonin
down-regulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription
factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and 
β-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with
tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer
specimens. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited EMT marker expression and lung cancer
metastasis to liver in vivo Finally, melatonin shows promise in the treatment of 
lung cancer metastasis and deserves further study.

Potential anti-cancer drugs are frequently of low efficacy in clinics due to the 
lack of predictive models or the insufficient employment of existing preclinical 
test systems. Three-dimensional (3D) in vitro engineered tumor models can better 
predict the efficacy of novel drugs by reproducing the in vivo tumor
microenvironment. In this study, three sources of scaffolds (decellularized lung 
scaffold, chitosan/gelatin scaffold, and poly-L-lactic acid scaffold)
incorporated with breast cancer cells (MCF-7, 4T1) were bioengineered as a
platform to study in vitro solid tumor development. The good biocompatibility of 
three scaffolds favored cell growth and proliferation. Cells in 3D scaffolds were
less sensitive to chemotherapy and exhibited characteristics of higher malignancy
compared to their 2D counterparts. The expression of breast cancer biomarkers in 
MCF-7 cells markedly up-regulated in 3D scaffolds in comparison with those in 2D 
cultures. Cells grown in 3D scaffolds were found to be more tumorigenic and
angiogenic in BABL/c mice xenografts than cells grown from monolayers. The
results demonstrate that 3D engineered tumor model can better mimic in vivo tumor
and can serve as a more appropriate platform for the study and screening of novel
cancer therapeutics.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CYP2A13
polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility using the HapMap database.
METHODS: A case-control analysis of 532 subjects with lung cancer and 614
controls with no personal history of the disease was performed. The tag SNPs
rs1645690 and rs8192789 for CYP2A13 were selected, and the genetic polymorphisms 
were confirmed experimentally through real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing
assay.
RESULTS: SNP frequency in this study was consistent with the HapMap Project
database of Han-Chinese and lung cancer risk was associated with CYP2A13
polymorphisms in non-smokers. CYP2A13 shares a 93.5% identity with CYP2A6 in the 
amino acid sequence and the homologous sequences may interfere with the study of 
SNPs of CYP2A13.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2A13 may be a potential key metabolic enzyme gene in the
carcinogenesis of lung cancer in non-smokers. The common polymorphisms of CYP2A13
may be candidate biomarkers for lung cancer susceptibility in Han-Chinese.

Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, is a major disease that threatens the
worldwide population. Among all cancer types, lung cancer has the highest
morbidity rate, with a survival rate of less than 5%. Various studies have
focused on discovering a potent anticancer drug that will increase the survival
rate of lung cancer patients. Lutein (3,3'-dihydroxy-β, ε-carotene), a carotenoid
present in fruits and vegetables, is one such compound that possesses excellent
antioxidant properties. The present study was designed to determine the
anticancer effect of lutein against A549, a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line.
The cytotoxic effect of lutein against lung cancer cells (A549 and HCC827) and
normal cells (BEAS-2B) was detected by MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The
Transwell assay was performed to detect the inhibitory potential of lutein
against cell invasion and migration of A549 cells. The induction of apoptosis by 
lutein in A549 was analyzed by a double-staining technique using TUNEL (terminal 
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) and DAPI
(4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining assays to confirm the molecular
mechanism exhibited by lutein to induce apoptosis through regulating the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling molecules that are often
deregulated in cancerous condition. The results show that lutein inhibits the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in A549, which may therefore be 
used as a potent natural anticancer drug with no side effects to treat lung
cancer.

We used blood serum samples collected from 31 lung cancer (LC) patients and 29
healthy volunteers in this study. Levels of serum metabolites were qualitative
quantified with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), and the data were
analyzed by partial least-squares discrimination analysis (PLS-DA). Based on the 
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes database, we performed pathway-based
analysis utilizing metabolites presented at differential abundance between the LC
serum samples and the normal healthy serum samples for systematical investigation
on the metabolic alterations associated with LC pathogenesis. Finally, we
analyzed the significantly enriched pathways as well as their relevant
differentially expressed messenger RNAs, and drawn a correlation network plot to 
identify the serum metabolic biomarkers and the significantly altered metabolic
pathways for LC. GC-MS analysis showed that 23 of the 169 metabolites identified 
were significantly different. PLS-DA model revealed that 13 of these metabolites 
were with variable importance > 1, and particularly five were with area under
curve > 0.9. Pathway-based analysis demonstrated that five of eight enriched
metabolic pathways were statistically significant with false discovery
rate < 0.05. Lastly, the correlation networks between these pathways and their
related genes suggested that 29 genes had correlation degree > 10, which were
mainly engaged in the purine metabolism. In conclusion, we identified
indole-3-lactate, erythritol, adenosine-5-phosphate, paracetamol and threitol as 
serum metabolic biomarkers for LC through metabolomics analysis. Besides, we
identified the purine metabolism as the significantly altered metabolic pathway
in LC with the help of transcriptomics analysis.

There is an increased demand for efficient biomarkers for the diagnosis of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study aimed to evaluate plasma levels of
TrxR activity in a large population to confirm its validity and efficacy in NSCLC
diagnosis. Blood samples were obtained from 1922 participants (638 cases of
NSCLC, 555 cases of benign lung diseases (BLDs) and 729 sex- and age-matched
healthy controls). The plasma levels of TrxR activity in patients with NSCLC
(15.66 ± 11.44 U/ml) were significantly higher (P < 0.01) than in patients with
BLDs (6.27 ± 3.78 U/ml) or healthy controls (2.05 ± 1.86 U/ml). The critical
value of plasma TrxR activity levels for diagnosis of NSCLC was set at 10.18
U/ml, with a sensitivity of 71.6% and a specificity of 91.9%. The combination of 
NSE, CEA, CA19-9, Cyfra21-1, and TrxR was more effective for NSCLC diagnosis
(sensitivity and specificity in the training set: 85.6%, 90.2%; validation set:
86.2%, 92.4%) than was each biomarker individually (P < 0.001). TrxR can also
efficiently distinguish the metastatic status of the tumor, and it can further
differentiate between various histological differentiations. Together, plasma
TrxR activity was identified as a convenient, non-invasive, and efficient
biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLCs, particularly for discriminating between
metastatic and non-metastatic tumors, or for histologic differentiation.

Tumor heterogeneity refers to distinct genomic or phenotypic characteristics of
tumor cells. Under the environmental or drug stress, tumor cells exhibit
different responses, corresponding to different properties of cell proliferation,
invasion, metastasis and drug resistance. In particular, a small fraction of
tumor cells are capable of detaching from primary tumor sites and initiating
distant metastases. Thus, tumor heterogeneity sets the basis for tumor resistance
and metastasis. Traditional methods in studying tumor heterogeneity are mainly
based on bulk cells from different locations in primary tumors, lacking analysis 
at the single-cell level and of metastatic tumor cells. This study establishes a 
single-cell method to study metastatic tumor cells in malignant pleural effusions
of lung cancer patients. Metabolically active tumor cells in malignant pleural
effusions are firstly identified with a metabolic marker 2-NBDG, a fluorescent
glucose analog. These metabolically active tumor cells are confirmed to harbor
the same driver oncogenic mutations by Sanger sequencing, followed by
high-throughput sequencing to analyze copy number variation profiles. Our results
show metastatic tumor cells in pleural effusion have the same driver mutations
but different features in copy number variation patterns. The study provides new 
insights to understand the mechanism of tumor metastasis.

Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide. However, the
molecular mechanisms of lung adenocarcinoma development are still unclear. This
study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of anti-lung cancer target
genes in different cancer stages and to explore their functions in tumor
development. Lung adenocarcinoma transcriptome and clinical data were downloaded 
from Genomic Data Commons Data Portal, and the anti-lung cancer target genes were
retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Integrity database. The results showed that 16
anti-lung target genes were deregulated in all stages. Among these target genes, 
fibroblast growth factor 22 showed the most important role in transcription
regulatory networks. Further analysis revealed that APC, BRIP1, and PTTG1 may
regulate fibroblast growth factor 22 and subsequently influence MAPK signaling
pathway, Rap1 signaling pathways, and other tumorigenic processes in all stages. 
Moreover, high fibroblast growth factor 22 expression leads to poor overall
survival (hazard ratio = 1.55, P = .019). These findings provide valuable
information for the pathological research and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.
Future studies are needed to verify these results.

non-small cell lung carcinoma cells via attenuation of epithelial to mesenchymal 
transition.

Fisetin (3,3',4',7-tetrahydroxyflavone) is a bioactive polyphenolic flavonoid
found in many fruits and vegetables. It exhibits a variety of pharmacological
activities including anticancer and anti-invasive effects. Epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) allows the tumor cells to acquire increased
migratory and invasive properties mediating their dissemination to faraway sites,
thus favoring metastasis. With metastatic lung cancer claiming the majority of
lung cancer-related deaths, agents targeting the pathways underlying metastasis
are translationally promising. In the present study, we have explored the
anti-metastatic effects of fisetin in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells
A549 and H1299 with emphasis on EMT. The results suggested a significant
inhibition in migration and invasion of NSCLC cells under non-cytotoxic
concentrations. Furthermore, an attenuation of the EMT was observed in both the
cell lines with upregulation in the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin in
A549 cells and ZO-1 in H1299 cells with concomitant downregulation of the
mesenchymal markers vimentin as well as N-cadherin along with invasion marker
MMP-2. Herein, the downregulation of the expression of NSCLC stem cell signature 
markers CD44 and CD133 was also observed. Fisetin decreased the expression of
multiple signaling proteins (β-catenin, NF-κB, EGFR, STAT-3) acting upstream to
EMT and known to be involved in induction and maintenance of mesenchymal
phenotype, which may explain the observed effects. Moreover, fisetin decreased
the ability of H1299 cells to form colonies on soft agar and potentiated the
cytotoxic effects of tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI), erlotinib. Overall, our
study suggested the ability of fisetin to serve as a potential therapeutic agent 
on its capacity to attenuate the EMT program and inhibit migration, invasion and 
stem cell phenotype of lung cancer cells.

The receptor-tyrosine-kinase (RTK)-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a
transmembrane glycoprotein regarded as a tumor-associated antigen. ROR1 plays an 
important role in cancer development, but the detailed function of ROR1 in
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. In this study, we first
detected ROR1 expression and evaluated the relationship between ROR1 expression
and the clinicopathological characteristics of DLBCL patients. Next we employed
shRNA-mediated knockdown of ROR1 in DLBCL cell line to explore the
characteristics of ROR1 in DLBCL development both in vitro and in vivo. The
results showed a significantly higher level of ROR1 in DLBCL tissues than in
lymphatic hyperplasia tissues. High ROR1 expression was correlated with
unfavorable prognosis in DLBCL patients. Furthermore, ROR1 knockdown inhibited
the growth and induced the apoptosis in DLBCL cells and xenografts. In addition, 
shROR1 inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, both in vitro
and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that ROR1 is a novel prognostic 
marker for DLBCL survival and ROR1 significantly promotes DLBCL tumorigenesis by 
regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Targeting ROR1 may provide a
promising strategy for DLBCL treatment. © 2019 BioFactors, 00(00):1-11, 2019.

BACKGROUND: CD44 isoforms serve as a marker for cancer stem cells. CD44 variant 9
(CD44v9) contributes to the defense against reactive oxygen species, resulting in
resistance to chemoradiotherapy. However, the significance of CD44v9 in patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma is unknown.
METHODS: We used immunohistochemical analysis to retrospectively analyze CD44v9
expression in 268 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and investigated the
association between CD44v9 expression and patients' clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: The expression of CD44v9 in 193 of 268 (72.0%) patients was
significantly associated with early-stage cancer, low-grade tumors, absence of
vessel and pleural invasion, and a mutated epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) gene. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that CD44v9 expression was
significantly associated with early-stage disease [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.59; p < 0.001] and mutant EGFR (OR 2.53, 95% CI
1.06-6.04; p = 0.036). The percentage of CD44v9-positive tumors was higher in the
earlier stages of disease; however, there was no significant difference in the
survival of patients in each stage of disease who had positive or negative CD44v9
expression.
CONCLUSION: CD44v9 was highly expressed in EGFR-mutant tumors, particularly in
early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that CD44v9 expression may play an
important role in EGFR-mutant tumors.

Many food-derived phytochemicals and their derivatives represent a cornucopia of 
new anti-cancer compounds. Luteolin (3,4,5,7-tetrahydroxy flavone) is a flavonoid
found in different plants such as vegetables, medicinal herbs, and fruits. It
acts as an anticancer agent against various types of human malignancies such as
lung, breast, glioblastoma, prostate, colon, and pancreatic cancers. It also
blocks cancer development in vitro and in vivo by inhibition of proliferation of 
tumor cells, protection from carcinogenic stimuli, and activation of cell cycle
arrest, and by inducing apoptosis through different signaling pathways. Luteolin 
can additionally reverse epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) through a
mechanism that involves cytoskeleton shrinkage, induction of the epithelial
biomarker E-cadherin expression, and by down-regulation of the mesenchymal
biomarkers N-cadherin, snail, and vimentin. Furthermore, luteolin increases
levels of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) by activation of lethal
endoplasmic reticulum stress response and mitochondrial dysfunction in
glioblastoma cells, and by activation of ER stress-associated proteins
expressions, including phosphorylation of eIF2α, PERK, CHOP, ATF4, and
cleaved-caspase 12. Accordingly, the present review article summarizes the
progress of recent research on luteolin against several human cancers.

Cancer immunotherapy, including immune checkpoint inhibitors, exerts beneficial
effects in cancer patients. However, immune checkpoint inhibitors are only
advantageous for a limited population of cancer patients. Therefore, companion
diagnostics are needed in order to identify patients for whom these therapies are
effective. In the present study, we evaluated detailed immunological aspects in
clinical specimens from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. We analyzed 
the immune profiles, T cell cytotoxicity, and TCR repertoire of peripheral blood,
normal lung tissue, and tumor tissue from NSCLC patients. By using bispecific
T-cell engager technology to assess the cytotoxicity of T cells, we found that
the cytotoxicity of tumor-infiltrated T cells closely correlated with that of
peripheral T cells. This correlation was supported by the immune profiles,
cytokine production, and results of the TCR repertoire analysis from these
specimens. We also found that the cytotoxicity of peripheral T cells has
potential as a predictor of the effects of nivolumab in the tumor
microenvironment. These results imply further applications to blood-based immune 
monitoring systems and predictive biomarkers for cancer immunotherapy.

Since tumor-draining pulmonary vein blood (PV) is enriched in tumor-secreted
products, we hypothesized that it would also be enriched in tumor-derived
exosomes, which would be important in the metastasis process. We characterized
exosomes from PV of 61 resected non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients to
evaluate its potential as relapse biomarkers. Exosomes were characterized using
transmission electron microscopy, western blot and nanoparticle tracking analysis
and we examined time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS). Differences
between PV and peripheral vein were found. PV was enriched in smaller exosomes
than the paired peripheral vein (p = 0.01). Moreover, PV exosome size mode was
able to identify relapsed patients (Area under the curve [AUC] = 0.781; 95%CI:
0.6641⁻0.8978), in whom exosome size was smaller (<112 nm; p < 0.001). The
combination of PV exosome size and N (lymph node involvement) showed an AUC of
0.89 (95%CI: 0.80⁻0.97). Moreover, smaller PV exosome size was associated with
shorter TTR (28.3 months vs. not reached, p < 0.001) and OS (43.9 months vs. not 
reached, p = 0.009). Multivariate analyses identified PV exosome size and stage
as independent prognostic markers for TTR and OS. PV exosome size is a promising 
relapse biomarker after surgery that can add valuable information to clinical
variables.

BACKGROUND: Pathologic fractures of the femur resulting from metastasis severely 
increase mortality in patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However,
factors associated with early mortality after surgery have not been elucidated.
QUESTIONS/PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to identify clinical and
laboratory factors available to surgeons before surgery for a metastatic femur in
patients with metastatic lung cancer that might be associated with mortality at 1
and 3 months.
METHODS: Between 2010 and 2014 we treated 126 patients for pathologic fracture of
the femur caused by NSCLC. Of those, complete data sets for the parameters of
interest (including clinical factors, laboratory factors, and survivorship) were 
available in 105 (83%). The factors we considered included sex, age, fracture
location, surgical procedure, postoperative complications, blood cell counts,
serum biomarkers, genetic alterations of primary cancer, chemotherapeutic agents,
preoperative radiation therapy, pleural effusion, bone and internal organ
metastasis, performance scores, and medical center where the treatment was
performed. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify factors
associated with mortality at 1 and 3 months.
RESULTS: Intertrochanteric location was associated with a higher risk of death
(odds ratio [OR], 17.0; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.65-109.5), lower serum
albumin level was associated with an increased risk of death (OR, 0.13; 95% CI,
0.028-0.60), and availability of a suitable chemotherapeutic target agent was
associated with a lower risk of death (OR, 0.28; 95% CI, 0.08-0.91) within 3
months of surgery. Undergoing reconstruction with an endoprosthesis was
associated with a higher risk of death (OR, 48.3; 95% CI, 1.7-1329) and elevated 
serum leukocyte count (OR, 1.2; 95% CI, 1.0-1.4) and elevated alanine
aminotransferase (ALT) were associated with a higher risk of death (OR, 1.1; 95% 
CI, 1.0-1.2) within 1 month of surgery.
CONCLUSIONS: Although the risk factors for early mortality need to be validated
by prospective studies, surgical options need to be reconsidered in patients with
femoral metastases from NSCLS showing high ALT or leukocytosis on the
preoperative blood test.
LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level III, prognostic study.

BACKGROUND: The classification of large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) has
generated considerable debate and has been revised since its recognition as a
separate entity. Although it shares clinical features with small cell lung
carcinoma (SCLC) and was classified with SCLC in the 2015 World Health
Organization classification system, numerous studies have revealed inferior
treatment outcomes of LCNEC when it was treated as SCLC. Because the incidence of
LCNEC is rare, its mutational landscape has not been comprehensively
interrogated.
METHODS: We performed capture-based ultra-deep targeted sequencing on tumor
samples of LCNEC, large cell carcinoma (LCC), and SCLC to elucidate its
biological relationship with these subtypes and to identify potentially
targetable molecular alterations.
RESULTS: Our data revealed a molecular signature, consisting of RUNX1, ERBB4,
BRCA1, and EPHA3, that is distinctively mutated in LCNEC. A majority (60%) of
LCNEC patients harbored copy number variations (CNVs). Interestingly, there were 
no common CNVs shared among the three subtypes: NFкBIA amplification was shared
between LCNEC and LCC, while AKT2 amplification was shared between LCNEC and
SCLC. Furthermore, genetic alterations in the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway were enriched
in all three subtypes.
CONCLUSION: Despite the histological and/or morphological similarities among
LCNEC, LCC, and SCLC, our data revealed a molecular signature, consisting of
RUNX1, ERBB4, BRCA1, and EPHA3, that is distinctively mutated in LCNEC, which has
the potential to be used as a panel of biomarkers to distinguish LCNEC from a
molecular perspective. Furthermore, the molecular distinction among the three
subtypes can also be reflected from CNV events.

Clinical evidence demonstrates that treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitor
immunotherapy agents can have considerable benefit across multiple tumours.
However, there is a need for the development of predictive biomarkers that
identify patients who are most likely to respond to immunotherapy. Comprehensive 
characterisation of tumours using genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic
approaches continues to lead the way in advancing precision medicine. Genetic
correlates of response to therapy have been known for some time, but recent
clinical evidence has strengthened the significance of high tumour mutational
burden (TMB) as a biomarker of response and hence a rational target for
immunotherapy. Concordantly, immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed clinical
practice for lung cancer and melanoma, which are tumour types with some of the
highest mutational burdens. TMB is an implementable approach for molecular
biology and/or pathology laboratories that provides a quantitative measure of the
total number of mutations in tumour tissue of patients and can be assessed by
whole genome, whole exome, or large targeted gene panel sequencing of biopsied
material. Currently, TMB assessment is not standardised across research and
clinical studies. As a biomarker that affects treatment decisions, it is
essential to unify TMB assessment approaches to allow for reliable, comparable
results across studies. When implementing TMB measurement assays, it is important
to consider factors that may impact the method workflow, the results of the
assay, and the interpretation of the data. Such factors include biopsy sample
type, sample quality and quantity, genome coverage, sequencing platform,
bioinformatic pipeline, and the definitions of the final threshold that
determines high TMB. This review outlines the factors for adoption of TMB
measurement into clinical practice, providing an understanding of TMB assay
considerations throughout the sample journey, and suggests principles to
effectively implement TMB assays in a clinical setting to aid and optimise
treatment decisions.

Advances in high-throughput technologies and their involvement in the 'omics' of 
cancer have made possible the identification of hundreds of biomarkers and the
development of predictive and prognostic platforms that model the management of
cancer from evidence-based medicine to precision medicine. Latin America (LATAM) 
is a region characterised by fragmented healthcare, high rates of poverty and
disparities to access to a basic standard of care not only for cancer but also
for other complex diseases. Patients from the public setting cannot afford
targeted therapy, the facilities offering genomic platforms are scarce and the
use of high-precision radiotherapy is limited to few facilities. Despite the fact
that LATAM oncologists are well-trained in the use of genomic platforms and
constantly participate in genomic projects, a medical practice based in precision
oncology is a great challenge and frequently limited to private practice. In
breast cancer, we are waiting for the results of large basket trials to
incorporate the detection of actionable mutations to select targeted treatments, 
in a similar way to the management of lung cancer. On the other hand and
paradoxically, in the 'one fit is not for all' era, clinical and genomic studies 
continue grouping our patients under the single label 'Latin American' or
'Hispanic' despite the different ancestries and genomic backgrounds seen in the
region. More regional cancer genomic initiatives and public availability of this 
data are needed in order to develop more precise oncology in locally advanced
breast cancer.

AIM: To investigate novel potential biomarkers for antidiastole of tuberculous
pleural effusion (TPE) from malignant pleural effusion (MPE).
MATERIALS & METHODS: iTRAQTM-coupled LC-MS/MS were applied to analyze the
proteome of TPE and MPE samples. The candidate proteins were verified by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.
RESULTS: A total of 432 differential proteins were identified. Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay revealed significantly higher levels of fibronectin (FN) and 
cathepsin G (CTSG) in MPE than in TPE, but lower levels of leukotriene-A4
hydrolase (LTA4H). The receiver operator characteristic values were 0.285 for FN,
0.64 for LTA4H, 0.337 for CTSG and 0.793 for a combination of these candidate
markers.
CONCLUSION: FN, LTA4H and CTSG were identified as potential biomarkers to
differentiate TPE from MPE and their combination exhibited higher diagnostic
capacity.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) leads to initial response in most patients with
EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In contrast, little is known of 
the subpopulation of patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who exhibit clinical
outcomes that require treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
Therefore, to identify eligible cases to treat with ICIs, we retrospectively
analyzed the correlation between clinical features and the efficacy of ICIs in
patients with EGFR mutations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC
harboring EGFR mutations who were treated with ICIs after developing resistance
to EGFR-TKIs between February 2016 and April 2018 at 6 institutions in Japan. The
association between clinical outcomes and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated.
RESULTS: We enrolled 27 patients who harbored EGFR-activating mutations. The
objective response and disease control rates were higher in patients with
uncommon EGFR mutations than in those with common EGFR mutations (71% vs 35.7%
and 57% vs 7%, P = 0.14 and P < 0.01, respectively). Patients with uncommon EGFR 
mutations or without T790M mutations exhibited a significantly longer median
progression-free survival than those with common EGFR mutations or with T790M
mutations (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and without T790M mutations are
associated with the best outcomes for treatment with immunotherapy among those
with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is
needed to validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders with EGFR
mutations.

The regulatory loop between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs has a
dynamic role in transcriptional and translational regulation, and is involved in 
cancer. However, the regulatory circuitry between lncRNAs and microRNAs in
tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that a nuclear lncRNA
LINC00336 is upregulated in lung cancer and functions as an oncogene by acting as
a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs). LINC00336 bound RNA-binding protein ELAVL1
(ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) using nucleotides 1901-2107 of LINC00336 and
the RRM interaction domain and key amino acids (aa) of ELAVL1 (aa 101-213),
inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, ELAVL1 increased LINC00336 expression by
stabilizing its posttranscriptional level, whereas LSH (lymphoid-specific
helicase) increased ELAVL1 expression through the p53 signaling pathway, further 
supporting the hypothesis that LSH promotes LINC00336 expression. Interestingly, 
LINC00336 served as an endogenous sponge of microRNA 6852 (MIR6852) to regulate
the expression of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), a surrogate marker of
ferroptosis. Finally, we found that MIR6852 inhibited cell growth by promoting
ferroptosis. These data show that the network of lncRNA and ceRNA has an
important role in tumorigenesis and ferroptosis.

This study aimed to clarify relationships among UDP-glucose-6 dehydrogenase
(UGDH) expression, clinicopathological factors, and the prognosis of patients,
and to determine the role of UGDH in lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Firstly, UGDH
expression and localization in 126 lung AC tissues were immunohistochemically
studied, and associations with clinicopathological parameters and patients'
prognosis were evaluated. Secondly, serum UGDH levels were measured in 267 lung
cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. Finally, the effects of UGDH knockdown 
by siRNA on migration and invasion abilities were analyzed. As a result, nuclear 
UGDH staining was significantly correlated with poorer differentiation, a larger 
tumor size, higher p-TNM stage, positive nodal metastasis, positive lymphatic
invasion, and positive vascular invasion in lung AC patients. Nuclear
UGDH-positive patients showed significantly poorer survival than nuclear
UGDH-negative patients. Serum UGDH levels were especially higher in lung AC
patients even in stage I than those in healthy controls. In lung AC cell lines,
nuclear expression levels of UGDH were higher in LC-2/ad cells than in A549
cells. UGDH siRNA-treated LC-2/ad cells showed significantly decreased migration 
and invasion abilities, but no significant differences were observed in UGDH
siRNA-treated A549 cells. These data indicate that UGDH expression and
localization are an early sero-diagnostic marker in addition to a poor prognostic
indicator in lung AC patients.

Background: Despite reports of socioeconomic disparities in rates of genetic
testing and targeted therapy treatment for metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), little is known about whether such disparities are changing over
time.Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis to identify disparities and
trends in genetic testing and treatment with erlotinib. Using the Surveillance,
Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-Medicare database, we identified 9,900
patients with stage IV NSCLC diagnosed in 2007 to 2011 at age 65 or older. We
performed logistic regression analyses to identify patient factors associated
with odds of receiving a genetic test and erlotinib treatment, and to assess
trends in these differences with respect to diagnosis year.Results: Patients were
more likely to receive genetic testing if they were under age 75 at diagnosis
[odds ratio (OR), 1.55] independent of comorbidity level, and this age-based gap 
showed a decrease over time (OR, 0.93). For untested patients, erlotinib
treatment was associated with race (OR, 0.58, black vs. white; OR, 2.45, Asian
vs. white), and was more likely among female patients (OR, 1.45); for tested
patients, erlotinib treatment was less likely among low-income patients (OR,
0.32). Most of these associations persisted or increased in
magnitude.Conclusions: Race and sex are associated with rates of erlotinib
treatment for patients who did not receive genetic testing, and low-income status
is associated with treatment rates for those who did receive testing. The racial 
disparity remained stable over time, while the income-based disparity grew
larger.Impact: Attention to reducing disparities is needed as precision cancer
treatments continue to be developed.

BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs contribute to chemotherapy response in different types of
cancer. We hypothesized that plasma miRNAs are potentially associated with
chemotherapy response in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fourteen candidate microRNAs were chosen from the
literature, and their plasma levels were measured by quantitative polymerase
chain reaction (PCR). Forty metastatic breast cancer patients were chosen as the 
training groups. The potential significant microRNAs were validated in another
103 plasma samples.
RESULTS: In the training set, we identified 3 microRNAs (miR-200a, miR-210, and
miR-451) as significantly dysregulated miRNAs between sensitive group (partial
response (and stable disease) and resistant group (progressive disease). Then, in
the validation set, miR-200a (area under the curve = 0.881, sensitivity = 94.1%, 
specificity = 76.7%) and miR-210 (area under the curve = 0.851, sensitivity =
88.2%, specificity = 72.1%) showed high diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing
sensitive group from resistant group. Furthermore, the plasma level of miR-200a
was significantly associated with the stage in surgery ( P = .035), and the high 
level of miR-210 expression was associated with internal organ metastasis (liver,
lung, and brain; P = .024).
CONCLUSIONS: Plasma miR-200a and miR-210 could be effective biomarkers for the
prediction of chemotherapy resistance in metastatic breast cancer patients.

PURPOSE: CheckMate 568 is an open-label phase II trial that evaluated the
efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab as first-line treatment
of advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed the
association of efficacy with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and
tumor mutational burden (TMB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients with previously
untreated, recurrent stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks
plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. The primary end point was objective
response rate (ORR) in patients with 1% or more and less than 1% tumor PD-L1
expression. Efficacy on the basis of TMB (FoundationOne CDx assay) was a
secondary end point.
RESULTS: Of treated patients with tumor available for testing, 252 patients (88%)
of 288 were evaluable for PD-L1 expression and 98 patients (82%) of 120 for TMB. 
ORR was 30% overall and 41% and 15% in patients with 1% or greater and less than 
1% tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively. ORR increased with higher TMB,
plateauing at 10 or more mutations/megabase (mut/Mb). Regardless of PD-L1
expression, ORRs were higher in patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb (n = 48:
PD-L1, ≥ 1%, 48%; PD-L1, < 1%, 47%) versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb (n = 50:
PD-L1, ≥ 1%, 18%; PD-L1, < 1%, 5%), and progression-free survival was longer in
patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb
(median, 7.1 v 2.6 months). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events
occurred in 29% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab was effective and tolerable as a
first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb was
associated with improved response and prolonged progression-free survival in both
tumor PD-L1 expression 1% or greater and less than 1% subgroups and was thus
identified as a potentially relevant cutoff in the assessment of TMB as a
biomarker for first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab.

BACKGROUND: Although tobacco involuntary smoking is an established risk factor
for lung cancer, the association with head and neck cancer (HNC) is not
established. We aimed to investigate this potential association in an East Asian 
population.
METHODS: We conducted a multicenter case-control study in East Asia including
eight centers. We restricted our analysis to never tobacco smokers (303 cases and
459 controls) and to never tobacco smokers/never alcohol drinkers (243 cases and 
403 controls).
RESULTS: Among never tobacco smokers, involuntary smoking was associated with a
1.47-fold increase in risk of HNC (95%CI = 1.02, 2.13) and a 1.8-fold increase in
the risk of oral cavity cancer (95%CI = 1.14, 2.92). Among never tobacco smokers 
who were also never alcohol drinkers, increased risks were detected for more than
3 h per day of involuntary smoking exposure and for 15 or more years of exposure.
A dose-response relation was suggested for frequency of exposure (p for
trend = 0.014) and for years of exposure (p for trend = 0.010) for oral cavity
cancer. We did not detect strong increases in the risk of the other HNC subsites.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study supports the association between involuntary smoking and
the risk of HNC. The association may be stronger for oral cavity cancer than for 
other HNC subsites.

Metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) is one of the
most abundant, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in normal tissues. This lncRNA is
highly conserved among mammalian species, and based on in vitro results, has been
reported to regulate alternative pre-mRNA splicing and gene expression. However, 
Malat1 knockout mice develop and grow normally, and do not show alterations in
alternative splicing. While MALAT1 was originally described as a prognostic
marker of lung cancer metastasis, emerging evidence has linked this lncRNA to
other cancers, such as breast cancer, prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, glioma,
and leukemia. The role described for MALAT1 is dependent on the cancer types and 
the experimental model systems. Notably, different or opposite phenotypes
resulting from different strategies for inactivating MALAT1 have been observed,
which led to distinct models for MALAT1's functions and mechanisms of action in
cancer and metastasis. In this review, we reflect on different experimental
strategies used to study MALAT1's functions, and discuss the current mechanistic 
models of this highly abundant and conserved lncRNA.

Progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), which is known to be highly specific and
sensitive to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), has been proven to be a valuable
substitute for neuron-specific enolase in SCLC diagnostics and monitoring,
especially in its early stages. The detection of ProGRP levels also facilitates a
selection of therapeutic treatments. For the fabrication of our proposed
biosensor, titanium (IV) oxide microparticles were first used, followed by
dispersing gold nanoparticles into chitosan and immobilizing them onto a carbon
paste electrode (CPE) surface. The developed immunosensor exhibits a much higher 
biosensing performance in comparison with current methods, when it comes to the
detection of ProGRP. Therefore, the proposed
CPE/TiO₂/(CS+AuNPs)/anti-ProGRP/BSA/ProGRP is excellent for the development of a 
compact diagnostics apparatus.

BACKGROUND: Neuron-specific enolase (NSE) is an important tumor marker in the
serum of patients with lung cancer. Elevated serum NSE levels are also associated
with many other diseases. However, there is no unified population reference
interval for serum NSE. This study aimed to investigate the distribution of serum
NSE in healthy Chinese adults aged 20-79 years and to establish its reference
interval in Chinese population.
METHODS: A total of 10 575 healthy subjects were in line with the requirements of
this study. The concentration of serum NSE was detected by a fully automated
Cobas e602 analyzer with matching reagents. The population reference interval for
serum NSE was established using the unilateral 95th percentile (P95 ) according
to standard guidelines.
RESULTS: The distributions of serum NSE were not significantly different between 
males and females (P > 0.05) and also did not differ by age (P > 0.05).
Therefore, the population reference interval for serum NSE was established as
upper limit 25.4 ng/mL (90% confidence interval: 24.5-26.2 ng/mL).
CONCLUSIONS: We established the first population reference interval for serum NSE
in a large healthy Chinese adult cohort, which was higher than that recommended
by Roche Diagnostics GmbH. This new reference interval is more practical and
applicable in Chinese adults.

OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause for
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Currently, early detection of NSCLC is one of
the main available strategies for improving its prognosis. Due to the lack of
non-invasive and convenient tools, early diagnosis of NSCLC remains poor.
Recently, it has been reported that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be stably 
detected in serum. Meanwhile, they play a powerful role as biomarkers in various 
tumors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the expression levels of
serum miR-182, 200b and 205 in NSCLC patients, and to investigate their
diagnostic and prognostic values.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
was carried out to measure the expressions of miR-182, 200b and 205 in NSCLC
tissues and normal controls. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was performed to assess the potential value of serum miRNAs for NSCLC
diagnosis. Meanwhile, transwell assays were performed to observe the functional
effects of miRNAs on the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells.
RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, serum levels of miR-182 and 205 in NSCLC 
patients were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-200b was remarkably
downregulated. ROC analysis indicated that miRNA array (miR-182, 200b and 205)
was useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of NSCLC. In addition, transwell assays
demonstrated that miR-182 promoted the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that serum miR-182, 200b and 205 might serve
as promising biomarkers for early detection and treatment of NSCLC.

Lung cancer is the most prevalent and deadly cancer worldwide. Immune checkpoint 
therapy, which targets regulatory pathways in T cells to boost anti-tumor immune 
response, has revolutionized lung cancer treatment paradigms. Inhibitors of the
most established immune checkpoints such as programmed death-1 (PD-1)/PD-ligand 1
(PD-L1) have been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in the
management of lung cancer. Despite the pronounced survival benefits that have
been seen with immune checkpoint inhibitors, not all lung cancer patients respond
to single-agent immunotherapy due to the complexity of the immune
microenvironment and tumor resistance. Alternative immune checkpoints beyond
PD-1/PD-L1 must be sought so that more patients can benefit from immune
checkpoint therapy. Additionally, novel combination strategies of immunotherapy
and conventional treatments (e.g., chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and targeted
therapy) have shown promise in some clinical trials. Meanwhile, identification of
predictive biomarkers is pivotal in selecting eligible patients for immunotherapy
and to guide individualized clinical decision-making. The future of immune
checkpoint therapy in lung cancer is not devoid of challenges, and more
prospective clinical studies are awaited to translate our understanding from
bench to bedside.

TIMM50 (Translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 50), also called TIM50,
plays an essential role in mitochondrial membrane transportation. The existing
literature suggests that TIMM50 may perform as an oncogenetic protein in breast
cancer. However, the molecular mechanism, especially in human non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), is uncertain to date. In the present study, using
immunohistochemistry, we found that TIMM50 expression significantly correlated
with larger tumor size (P = 0.049), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.001), positive
regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007), and poor overall survival
(P = 0.001). Proliferation and invasion assay showed that TIMM50 dramatically
promoted the ability of proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells. Subsequent
Western blotting results revealed that TIMM50 enhanced the expression of Cyclin
D1 and Snail, and inhibited the expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, TIMM50
facilitated the expression of phosphorylated ERK and P90RSK. Incorporation of ERK
inhibitor counteracted the upregulating expression of CyclinD1, and Snail, and
downregulating expression of E-cadherin expression induced by TIMM50
overexpression. In conclusion, our data indicated that TIMM50 facilitated tumor
proliferation and invasion of NSCLC through enhancing phosphorylation of its
downstream ERK/P90RSK signaling pathway. We speculated that TIMM50 might be a
useful prognosis marker of NSCLC patients.

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are cell-derived nanoscale vesicles that provide
promising biomarkers for the non-invasive diagnosis of cancer because they carry 
important cancer-related DNA, RNA and protein biomarkers. However, the clinical
application of EVs is limited by tedious and non-standardized isolation methods
that require bulky instrumentation. Here, we propose an easy-to-operate, simple
dielectrophoretic (DEP) method for EV isolation with higher recovery efficiency
(>83%) and higher purity than ultracentrifugation (UC). The DEP chip reduces the 
isolation procedure from 8 h to 30 min. To facilitate subsequent analysis, our
DEP chip achieved integration of EV isolation and in situ lysis of EVs for the
first time. Our chip also achieved on-chip siRNA delivery to EVs isolated by DEP.
We found that EVs isolated from the plasma of lung cancer patients contained
higher levels of miR-21, miR-191 and miR-192 compared to those from healthy
people. With on-chip detection, EGFR in EVs could distinguish lung cancer
patients from healthy people. Overall, this study provides an efficient and
practical approach to the isolation and detection of EVs, which could be used for
the early diagnosis of lung cancer.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological form of lung cancer
that is clinically diagnosed. The aim of this study is to explore the novel genes
associated with LUAD tumorigenesis. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the 
data were obtained from several publicly available databases, such as the Gene
Expression Omnibus, the Human Protein Atlas project, and the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia. The clinical relevance of these novel genes in LUAD was further
examined by immunohistochemistry. We identified the overlapping differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) in five independent microarray data sets from the Gene
Expression Omnibus database ( GSE75037 , GSE85716 , GSE85841 , GSE63459 , and
GSE32867 ). Using the criteria of |log (fold change)| ≥ 1 and P value <0.05, 167 
genes were preliminarily validated as co-DEGs. Protein-protein interaction
network analysis indicated that caveolin 1 (CAV1) and decorin (DCN) levels were
significantly reduced and that these genes were the most promising predictive
biomarkers for the occurrence and prognosis of LUAD. A cell proliferation assay
indicated that overexpressed CAV1 and DCN could significantly inhibit the
proliferation rate of A549 and H157 cells. Additionally, these two downregulated 
candidate genes were further verified by immunohistochemistry conducted on a LUAD
tissue array and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including those using the
Oncomine platform and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Our study demonstrates
low levels of CAV1 and DCN in LUAD. An understanding of their functional roles in
LUAD biology would give us important insights that would be useful in further
investigations.

Pharmacotherapeutic Management of Wilms Tumor: An Update.

Although differences exist in treatment and risk-stratification strategies for
children with Wilms tumor (WT) between the European [International Society of
Paediatric Oncology (SIOP)] and American [Children's Oncology Group (COG)] study 
groups, outcomes are very similar, with an overall survival of > 85%. Future
strategies aim to de-intensify treatment and reduce toxicity for children with a 
low risk of relapse and intensify treatment for children with high-risk disease. 
For metastatic WT, response of lung nodules to chemotherapy is used as a marker
to modify treatment intensity. For recurrent WT, a unified approach based on the 
use of agents that were not used for primary therapy is being introduced.
Irinotecan is being explored as a new strategy in both metastatic and relapsed
WT. Introduction of biology-driven approaches to risk stratification and new drug
treatments has been slower in WT than in some other childhood cancers. While
several new biological pathways have been identified recently in WT, their
individual rarity has hampered their translation into clinical utility.
Identification of robust prognostic factors requires extensive international
collaborative studies because of the low proportion who relapse or die. Molecular
profiling studies are in progress that should ultimately improve both risk
classification and signposting to more targeted therapies for the small group for
whom current therapies fail. Accrual of patients with WT to early-phase trials
has been low, and the efficacy of these new agents has so far been very
disappointing. Better in vitro model systems to test mechanistic dependence are
needed so available new agents can be more rationally prioritized for recruitment
of children with WT to early-phase trials.

PURPOSE: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors have produced
demonstrable but limited benefit for various cancers. One mechanism of resistance
includes revascularization, secondary to upregulation of alternative
pro-angiogenic platelet-derived growth factor receptor and fibroblast growth
factor receptor pathways. Nintedanib is an oral, triple kinase inhibitor that
blocks these pathways and may improve anti-tumor activity by overcoming
resistance to anti-VEGF therapies. The primary objective of this first in-human
study was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of nintedanib in combination
with bevacizumab.
METHODS: Patients were treated with escalating doses of nintedanib (150 mg or
200 mg oral twice daily) and bevacizumab (15 mg/kg once intravenously every
3 weeks) until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity using standard 3 + 3 
phase 1 design. Plasma levels of angiogenic biomarkers were correlated with
clinical outcomes.
RESULTS: Eighteen patients with advanced tumors [lung (n = 9), colon (n = 8), and
cervical (n = 1)] previously treated with at least two lines of chemotherapy
including bevacizumab (n = 9, 50%) were enrolled. The highest dose of nintedanib 
was 200 mg twice a day with no observed dose-limiting toxicities (DLT). Common
adverse events (AE) were fatigue (grade 1-3) and diarrhea (grade 1-2). Durable
clinical response was observed in 55% patients pretreated with bevacizumab (1
complete and 4 stable response). Better disease control was correlated with
higher than median baseline values for VEFGR2 and E-selectin, and lower levels
for SDF-1α.
CONCLUSION: Nintedanib was well-tolerated with bevacizumab with no DLT.
Significant clinical activity was observed, including in bevacizumab-pretreated
patients, suggesting nintedanib can overcome bevacizumab resistance.

Gynecomastia with mastodynia and galactorrhea as a paraneoplastic syndrome due to
lung cancer with complete response after surgical excision is rare. A 62-year-old
Caucasian male presented with mastodynia, galactorrhea and right breast
enlargement. Chest x-ray revealed a left upper lobe tumor. The patient had high
levels of serum beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (b-HCG) and prolactine.
Complete staging was negative for metastases. A typical left upper lobectomy with
radical mediastinal lymph node dissection was performed. Pathology report was
consistent with a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma (T2N1M0).
Immunohistochemically, multinucleate cells and occasional mononucleate tumor
cells showed positivity for human chorionic gonadotropin. The patient received
adjuvant chemotherapy with cisplatin - navelbine. One year later physical
examination showed regression of both gynecomastia and mastodynia and there was
no nipple discharge, while he is free from local or distant metastatic disease
and the b-HCG level is normal (1,59 mIU/ml). This case represents a very rare,
first manifestation of lung cancer. Galactorrhea, mastodynia and gynecomastia
were the initial symptoms, which totally resolved following the successful
surgical resection and adjuvant chemotherapy. In this case, prolactin and b-HCG
are useful biomarkers during follow up for checking local or distal recurrence of
the disease.

Roles of Oncogenic Long Non-coding RNAs in Cancer Development.

Do H(1), Kim W(1).

Author information:

Cheongju 28173, Korea.

Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are classified as RNAs that are longer than 200
nucleotides and cannot be translated into protein. Several studies have
demonstrated that lncRNAs are directly or indirectly involved in a variety of
biological processes and in the regulation of gene expression. In addition,
lncRNAs have important roles in many diseases including cancer. It has been shown
that abnormal expression of lncRNAs is observed in several human solid tumors.
Several studies have shown that many lncRNAs can function as oncogenes in cancer 
development through the induction of cell cycle progression, cell proliferation
and invasion, anti-apoptosis, and metastasis. Oncogenic lncRNAs have the
potential to become promising biomarkers and might be potent prognostic targets
in cancer therapy. However, the biological and molecular mechanisms of lncRNA
involvement in tumorigenesis have not yet been fully elucidated. This review
summarizes studies on the regulatory and functional roles of oncogenic lncRNAs in
the development and progression of various types of cancer.

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
with little improvement in patient survival rates in the past decade. Long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining importance as possible biomarkers with
prognostic potential. By large-scale data mining, we identified LINC00261 as a
lncRNA which was significantly downregulated in lung cancer. Low expression of
LINC00261 was associated with recurrence and poor patient survival in lung
adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the gene pair of LINC00261 and its neighbor FOXA2 were 
significantly co-regulated. LINC00261 as well as FOXA2 negatively correlated with
markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and were suppressed by the
EMT inducer TGFβ. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from lung
cancer cell lines could further verify the association of high LINC00261/FOXA2
expression to an epithelial gene signature. Furthermore, higher expression of the
LINC00261/FOXA2 locus was associated with lung cancer cell lines with lower
migratory capacity. All these data establish LINC00261 and FOXA2 as an
epithelial-specific marker pair, downregulated during EMT and lung cancer
progression, and associated with lower cell migration potential in lung cancer
cells.

Localized Chemotherapy Prevents Lung Metastasis After Incomplete Microwave
Ablation of Hepatic VX2 Tumor.

Hu J, Dong Y, Ding L, Mao F, Cao J, Sun Y, Wang W, Duan Y.

Microwave ablation is emerging as an effective local treatment for solid tumors. 
The efficiency of microwave ablation in treating hepatocellular carcinoma is
evidently limited by the incomplete ablation of large tumors and tumors in
high-risk locations. Microwave ablation in conjunction with localized
chemotherapy is a promising strategy for cancer therapy. In this study, we
prepared As₂O₃-mPEG-PLGA-PLL nanoparticles by double emulsion method and
investigated their efficacy to eliminate residual cancer cells and inhibit lung
metastasis after microwave ablation of hepatic VX2 tumor. As₂O₃ formulations were
administered into the residual tumor area for four times over four weeks after
microwave ablation (As₂O₃ equivalent to 1 mg/kg body weight). Both As₂O₃
treatments showed good therapeutic effects, including inhibiting lung metastasis 
and decreasing the stiffness of the residual tumors. Additionally,
As₂O₃-mPEG-PLGA-PLL nanoparticles had better anti-cancer efficacy than did the
As₂O₃ treatment. Compared with As₂O₃ alone, As₂O₃-mPEG-PLGA-PLL nanoparticles
could increase the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin, decrease the
expression of mesenchymal markers N-cadherin and snail, as well as down-regulate 
the expressions of PCNA (proliferation marker), CD34 (angiogenesis marker). The
As₂O₃-mPEG-PLGA-PLL nanoparticles are an effective formulation for preventing
lung metastasis through reversing EMT progress after incomplete ablation, thus it
has the potential to be a new therapy strategy for HCC patients.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to detect the expression of fork-head box D3
(FOXD3) and investigate its diagnostic value in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS The relative expression of FOXD3 at mRNA and
protein levels was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis, respectively. Chi-square 
test was used to explore the relevance of FOXD3 expression with clinical features
of NSCLC patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was built to
estimate the diagnostic value of FOXD3 in distinguishing NSCLC patients from
healthy controls. RESULTS Serum FOXD3 expression was weakly expressed in NSCLC
patients compared to the controls at mRNA and protein levels (P<0.001) and low
FOXD3 expression was positively correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis,
and differentiation. The ROC curve indicated that FOXD3 acts as a diagnostic
bio-marker for NSCLC patients, with an AUC of 0.826 corresponding to a
sensitivity of 77.1% and a specificity of 74.6%, and an optimal cutoff point of
2.38. CONCLUSIONS Decreased expression of serum FOXD3 was observed in NSCLC
patients, and it was found to be a potential molecular marker for the diagnosis
of NSCLC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment was booming at this year's ASCO 2018
meeting as several well-performed phase III trials with practice-changing
potential were presented. Thereby immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) consolidated
its major role in the treatment of NSCLC patients without genetic alterations and
extended its use by showing impressive data on ICB combination therapies (mainly 
combined with chemotherapy). Furthermore the role of predictive biomarkers for
ICB therapy (Programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1] expression, tumor mutational
burden [TMB] testing and others) have been further developed and blood-based
tests were presented with promising data revealing the potential of this
minimally invasive method for treatment monitoring and guidance in the future.
Nevertheless the best biomarker is still elusive and future research is ongoing
and might be a multimodal approach combining different modalities. No major
studies concerning new genetic alterations or innovative targets were presented
and the focus in genetic driven NSCLC was the evaluation of combinational
approaches (e.g. in epidermal growth factor receptor [EGFR] mutation positve
patients, EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI] plus anti-angiogenic agent or
chemotherapy backbone). The presented results showed some benefit for the
combinational approach; however toxicity might be an issue and further validation
is necessary. Summarizing, ASCO 2018 showed that combinational approaches will be
the future standard treatment in NSCLC and that biomarker identification is more 
heterogeneous and complex than anticipated, but presented next generation
techniques may pave the way to a more personalized cancer therapy.

IMMUNOTHERAPY IN THORACIC ONCOLOGY: STATE OF THE ART AND PERSPECTIVES: Immune
checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) are monoclonal antibodies that inhibit molecular
interaction between an immune checkpoint and its ligand, which leads to increased
anti-tumoral immune response, Programmed Death 1 (PD-1) and Cytotoxic
T-Lymphocyte Associated-4 (CTLA-4) are the most commonly known immune
checkpoints. ICIs are currently placed early in the course of the treatment of
patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In France, approvals have been 
pronounced for nivolumab and pembrolizumab (anti-PD-1 antibodies) as second-line 
treatments after chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, and pembrolizumab 
has been approved as a first-line treatment in patients with advanced NSCLC,
without EGFR mutation or ALK rearrangement, with strong (≥50%) PD-L1 (Programmed 
Death Ligand 1) expression. Atezolizumab is currently soon to be approved as a
second-line treatment. Numerous studies are currently evaluating ICIs in thoracic
oncology. In this article, we will develop perspectives regarding ICIs for early 
stage or locally advanced NSCLCs, ICIs used in other thoracic cancers (small cell
lung cancer, malignant pleural mesothelioma, thymic epithelial tumors), and
trials with combinations involving ICIs: two ICIs combined, or ICIs combined with
chemotherapy, radiotherapy or other anti-cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the function of SMAD3 (SMAD family member 3) 
in regulating PAX6 (paired box 6) in non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: First, qRT-PCR was employed to detect SMAD3 expression in cancer tissues
along with normal tissues and four cell lines, including BEAS-2B, H125, HCC827
and A549 cells. SMAD3 was knocked down by small interference RNA (siRNA), and
then its expression was determined via qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The
correlation between SMAD3 and PAX6 was determined by double luciferase reporter
experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cell viability was
evaluated by CCK-8 and colony forming assays, while cell migration and invasion
were detected by Transwell analysis.
RESULTS: SMAD3 and PAX6 were upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cancer cells.
Knocking down SMAD3 and PAX6 by transfection with siRNAs specifically suppressed 
the expression of SMAD3 and PAX6 mRNA and protein levels. SMAD3 could promote
PAX6 transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter. Reduced expression of
SMAD3 led to the downregulation of PAX6 mRNA and protein levels along with
decreased cell migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and
HCC827 cells. PAX6 overexpression altered the si-SMAD3-induced inhibition of cell
migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and HCC827 cells.
Additionally, PAX6 knockdown alone also repressed the cell migration, invasion,
proliferation and viability of the cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: SMAD3 promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by
upregulating PAX6 expression.

The potential role of total saponins extracted from Lilium lancifolium bulbs
(TSLL) on the proliferation, apoptosis, migration and invasion of human lung
cancer A549 cells and its possible mechanism were discussed. Effect of TSLL on
proliferation of A549 cells were detected by CCK-8, clone formation assay and EdU
staining. Effect of TSLL on apoptosis morphology of A549 cells was observed by
fluorescence microscope using Annexin V/PI double staining and Hoechst 33342
staining. Effect of TSLL on cell migration and invasion was detected by Transwell
migration test and Transwell invasion test, respectively. Western blot was used
to detect TSLL on the expression change of intracellular associated proteins.
Results showed that TSLL intervention in A549 cells within 24, 48 or 72 h
significantly inhibited cell growth, and its IC₅₀values were about 229, 173 and
71 mg·L⁻¹, respectively. TSLL significantly reduced the clone formation rate of
A549 cells and decreased the DNA synthesis rate of A549 cells in a concentration 
dependent manner. TSLL induced A549 cells apoptosis and reduced the migratory
behavior of A549 cells. TSLL decreased invasion of A549 cells to the artificial
basement membrane. The expression level of intracellular PCNA and the ratio of
Bcl-2/Bax protein were down-regulated and procaspase 3 was activated. In
addition, TSLL had no obvious effect on epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT)
related marker proteins E-cadherin and vimentin expression. The above results
indicated that TSLL possess inhibitory effects against proliferation, migration
and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells and apoptosis-induced effect. The
anti-proliferation effect of TSLL is very likely by inhibiting intracellular DNA 
synthesis through reducing the expression of PCNA in lung cancer cells. And the
apoptosis induction of TSLL on lung cancer cells is associated with the
regulation of Bcl-2 and Bax proteins expression. Nevertheless, there is no
incontestable correlation between anti-invasion and metastasis effects of TSLL
and EMT in lung cancer cells.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a new blood supply style in tumors and has long been
treated as a useful factor in malignant tumor metastasis and prognosis. Notch4 (a
marker of Notch signaling pathway receptors), DLL4 (a marker of Notch signaling
pathway ligands) and KAI1/CD82 (a suppressor gene of tumor metastasis) are all
effective predictive factors for tumor metastasis. In this study, we analyzed
correlations among VM, Notch4, DLL4, and KAI1/CD82 in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and their respective associations with patients' clinicopathological
parameters and survival rate in NSCLC.Positive rates of VM, Notch4, DLL4, and
KAI1/CD82 in 189 whole NSCLC specimens were detected by histochemical and
immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, patients' clinicopathological information
was also collected.Positive rates of VM, Notch4, and DLL4 were significantly
higher, and levels of KAI1/CD82 were significantly lower in NSCLC than in normal 
lung tissues. Positive rates of VM, Notch4, and DLL4 were positively associated
with tumor size, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM) and
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and inversely with patients, overall survival 
(OS) time and positive rate of DLL4 were positively associated with tumor grade. 
Levels of KAI1/CD82 were negatively associated with tumor size, LNM, DM, and TNM 
stage. The KAI1/CD82+ subgroup had significantly longer OS time than did the
KAI1/CD82- subgroup. In multivariate analysis, high VM, Notch4, DLL4 levels,
tumor size, LNM, DM, TNM stage, and low KAI1/CD82 levels were potential to be
independent prognostic factors for overall survival time (OST) in NSCLC
patients.VM and the expression of Notch4, DLL4, and KAI1/CD82 represent promising
markers for tumor metastasis and prognosis, and maybe potential therapeutic
targets for NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: The US guidelines recommend low-dose CT (LDCT) lung cancer screening 
for high-risk individuals. New solid nodules after baseline screening are common 
and have a high lung cancer probability. Currently, no evidence exists concerning
the risk stratification of non-resolving new solid nodules at first LDCT
screening after initial detection.
METHODS: In the Dutch-Belgian Randomized Lung Cancer Screening (NELSON) trial,
7295 participants underwent the second and 6922 participants the third screening 
round. We included participants with solid nodules that were registered as new or
<15 mm³ (study detection limit) at previous screens and received additional
screening after initial detection, thereby excluding high-risk nodules according 
to the NELSON management protocol (nodules ≥500 mm3).
RESULTS: Overall, 680 participants with 1020 low-risk and intermediate-risk new
solid nodules were included. A total of 562 (55%) new solid nodules were
resolving, leaving 356 (52%) participants with a non-resolving new solid nodule, 
of whom 25 (7%) were diagnosed with lung cancer. At first screening after initial
detection, volume doubling time (VDT), volume, and VDT combined with a predefined
≥200 mm3 volume cut-off had high discrimination for lung cancer (VDT, area under 
the curve (AUC): 0.913; volume, AUC: 0.875; VDT and ≥200 mm3 combination, AUC:
0.939). Classifying a new solid nodule with either ≤590 days VDT or ≥200 mm3
volume positive provided 100% sensitivity, 84% specificity and 27% positive
predictive value for lung cancer.
CONCLUSIONS: More than half of new low-risk and intermediate-risk solid nodules
in LDCT lung cancer screening resolve. At follow-up, growth assessment
potentially combined with a volume limit can be used for risk stratification.

Cell lines are essential tools to standardize and compare experimental findings
in basic and translational cancer research. The current dogma states that cancer 
stem cells feature an increased tumor initiation capacity and are also
chemoresistant. Here, we identified and comprehensively characterized three
morphologically distinct cellular subtypes in the non-small cell lung cancer cell
line A549 and challenge the current cancer stem cell dogma. Subtype-specific
cellular morphology is maintained during short-term culturing, resulting in the
formation of holoclonal, meroclonal, and paraclonal colonies. A549 holoclone
cells were characterized by an epithelial and stem-like phenotype, paraclone
cells featured a mesenchymal phenotype, whereas meroclone cells were
phenotypically intermediate. Cell-surface marker expression of subpopulations
changed over time, indicating an active epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), in vitro and in vivo. EMT has been associated with the overexpression of
the immunomodulators PD-L1 and PD-L2, which were 37- and 235-fold overexpressed
in para- versus holoclone cells, respectively. We found that DNA methylation is
involved in epigenetic regulation of marker expression. Holoclone cells were
extremely sensitive to cisplatin and radiotherapy in vitro, whereas paraclone
cells were highly resistant. However, inhibition of the receptor tyrosine kinase 
AXL, whose expression is associated with an EMT, specifically targeted the
otherwise highly resistant paraclone cells. Xenograft tumor formation capacity
was 24- and 269-fold higher in holo- than mero- and paraclone cells,
respectively. Our results show that A549 subpopulations might serve as a unique
system to explore the network of stemness, cellular plasticity, tumor initiation 
capacity, invasive and metastatic potential, and chemo/radiotherapy resistance.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which accounts for about 15% of lung cancer cases,
is an aggressive disease characterized by rapid growth and early widespread
metastasis. Despite sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy, SCLC is
vulnerable to get resistant and has high recurrence rates. In recent years,
immunotherapy has shown good antitumor activity, especially programmed death
receptor-1/ligand-L1 (PD-1/L1) and cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4
(CTLA-4) Checkpoint inhibitors have changed the pattern of tumor treatment, and
SCLC has high immunogenicity, high mutation load and other favorable immune
factors, so immuno-checkpoint inhibitors may become an important breakthrough in 
SCLC treatment. This article will briefly review the clinical research of
immunotherapy for small cell lung cancer. .

INTRODUCTION: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a tumor with a poor prognosis,
often diagnosed in an advanced stage. Despite aggressive treatment of early and
locally advanced disease, SCLC often relapses. First line chemotherapy provides
good response rates in advanced disease, but progression free and overall
survival are limited. New drugs such as some targeted therapies and immune
therapies are promising in SCLC. Areas covered: In this review, we discuss the
preclinical rationale and trial data for targeted therapies and immune therapies 
in SCLC, with a specific focus on clinical trials. Expert commentary: Lack of
identification of clear prognostic and predictive biomarkers has limited the
advances in treatment efficacy. This has most likely been the main cause of
failure for compounds tested so far. Due to the highly mutational profile and the
rapid growth pattern of SCLC, immunotherapy combined with chemotherapy seems the 
most promising treatment option. Concerning targeted agents, achievements made so
far are small, but DLL3-antibodies or combinations of PARPi and immunotherapy
could be very promising. These promising strategies also need testing in limited 
disease.

Combining biomarker trajectories to improve diagnostic accuracy in prospective
cohort studies with verification bias.

In this paper, we develop methods to combine multiple biomarker trajectories into
a composite diagnostic marker using functional data analysis (FDA) to achieve
better diagnostic accuracy in monitoring disease recurrence in the setting of a
prospective cohort study. In such studies, the disease status is usually verified
only for patients with a positive test result in any biomarker and is missing in 
patients with negative test results in all biomarkers. Thus, the test result will
affect disease verification, which leads to verification bias if the analysis is 
restricted only to the verified cases. We treat verification bias as a missing
data problem. Under both missing at random (MAR) and missing not at random (MNAR)
assumptions, we derive the optimal classification rules using the Neyman-Pearson 
lemma based on the composite diagnostic marker. We estimate thresholds adjusted
for verification bias to dichotomize patients as test positive or test negative, 
and we evaluate the diagnostic accuracy using the verification bias corrected
area under the ROC curves (AUCs). We evaluate the performance and robustness of
the FDA combination approach and assess the consistency of the approach through
simulation studies. In addition, we perform a sensitivity analysis of the
dependency between the verification process and disease status for the approach
under the MNAR assumption. We apply the proposed method on data from the
Religious Orders Study and from a non-small cell lung cancer trial.

DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHS) are abundant in regulatory elements, such as
promoter, enhancer and transcription factor binding sites. Many studies have
revealed that disease-associated variants were concentrated in DHS related
regions. However, limited studies are available on the roles of DHS-related
variants in lung cancer. In the current study, we performed a large-scale
case-control study with 20,871 lung cancer cases and 15,971 controls to evaluate 
the associations between regulatory genetic variants in DHS and lung cancer
susceptibility. The eQTL (expression quantitative trait loci) analysis and
pathway enrichment analysis were performed to identify the possible target genes 
and pathways. Additionally, we performed motif-based analysis to explore the lung
cancer related motifs using sequence kernel association test (SKAT). Two novel
variants, rs186332 in 20q13.3 (C>T, OR = 1.17, 95% CI: 1.10-1.24, P = 8.45×10-7) 
and rs4839323 in 1p13.2 (T>C, OR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.89-0.95, P = 1.02×10-6) showed
significant association with lung cancer risk. The eQTL analysis suggested that
these two SNPs might regulate the expression of MRGBP and SLC16A1 respectively.
What's more, the expression of both MRGBP and SLC16A1 were aberrantly elevated in
lung tumor tissues. The motif-based analysis identified 10 motifs related to the 
risk of lung cancer (P < 1.71×10-4). Our findings suggested that variants in DHS 
might modify lung cancer susceptibility through regulating the expression of
surrounding genes. This study provided us a deeper insight into the roles of DHS 
related genetic variants for lung cancer.

Lung cancer, with about 85% being non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), is one of
the most common malignant tumors and the leading cause of cancer-related death in
both men and women. Exosomes are defined as extracellular vesicles with a
diameter of 30-100 nm, containing proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, etc., which
are secreted by various cells in the microenvironment. Increasing evidences
implicate that exosomes act as important molecular vehicles participating in
physiological and pathological processes, such as tumor initiation, progression, 
and response to therapy in a number of human cancers including NSCLC. The aim of 
this review is to disclose the function of exosomes in NSCLC carcinogenesis, and 
discuss the potential clinical significance in the diagnosis, prognosis and of
treatment NSCLC.

Importance: Administration of anti-programmed cell death protein 1 (anti-PD-1) is
now standard therapy in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However,
immune checkpoint inhibitors, including anti-PD-1, have not been assessed in
patients with subclinical disease with advanced NSCLC, and no useful clinical
biomarkers have been associated with immune-related adverse events (irAEs) among 
these patients treated with anti-PD-1.
Objective: To assess the safety and efficacy of anti-PD-1 treatment in patients
with subclinical disease with advanced NSCLC and with or without preexisting
autoimmune markers, including rheumatoid factor, antinuclear antibody,
antithyroglobulin, and antithyroid peroxidase; and to assess potential clinical
biomarkers that may be meaningfully and conveniently associated with clinical
benefit or with irAEs following anti-PD-1 treatment.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This medical records analysis retrospectively 
evaluated 137 patients who received nivolumab or pembrolizumab monotherapy at
Sendai Kousei Hospital in Japan between January 2016 and January 2018. Treatment 
efficacy and irAEs were evaluated along with candidate factors that may be
associated with irAEs.
Exposures: Absence or presence of specific autoimmune markers and antibodies
before treatment.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Preexisting antibodies and autoimmune markers,
progression-free survival (PFS), and irAEs.
Results: Of 137 patients with advanced NSCLC, 105 were men, the median age was 68
(range, 36-88) years, 99 underwent nivolumab monotherapy, 38 underwent
pembrolizumab monotherapy, and 134 had an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group
performance status of 0 or 1. The median PFS was 6.5 (95% CI, 4.4-12.9) months
among patients with examined preexisting antibodies and 3.5 (95% CI, 2.4-4.1)
months among patients without, suggesting significantly better prognosis in the
former. The hazard ratio for disease progression or death in the presence of the 
examined preexisting antibodies was 0.53 (95% CI, 0.36-0.79; P = .002). The PFS
was significantly longer among patients with any preexisting antibodies than
among those without. The examined preexisting antibodies (48 patients [73%]) and 
rheumatoid factor (26 patients [39%]) were more common among patients who
developed irAEs. Multivariate analysis indicated that the presence of the
examined preexisting antibodies was independently associated with irAEs (odds
ratio, 3.25; 95% CI, 1.59-6.65; P = .001). Skin reactions were more frequent
among patients with preexisting rheumatoid factor (47% vs 24%, P = .02), whereas 
thyroid dysfunction was more frequent among patients with preexisting antithyroid
antibodies (20% vs 1%, P < .001).
Conclusions and Relevance: The presence of the examined preexisting antibodies
was associated with clinical benefit and with the development of irAEs in
patients with NSCLC treated with nivolumab or pembrolizumab. Thus, the presence
of these autoimmune markers may help determine the risk-benefit ratio for
individual patients with NSCLC, maximizing therapeutic benefits while minimizing 
irAEs.

Favorable progression-free survival in women with two different histopathological
subtypes of bilateral breast cancer.

Key Laboratory of Biotherapy, West China Hospital of Sichuan University, Chengdu,
Sichuan, China.

Sichuan, China.

Purpose: The aim of this study was to classify bilateral breast cancers (BBCs)
into two groups according to histopathological or molecular subtypes of the two
breast diseases in each patient and to study their characteristics in relation to
survival outcomes.
Methods: Fifty-six BBC patients were enrolled in the study. They were classified 
according to whether the two breast diseases were of the same or different
histopathological subtypes (defined as S-his or D-his groups) and molecular
subtypes (defined as S-mole and D-mole groups). Progression-free survival (PFS), 
overall survival (OS), and important characteristics were then compared between
the groups.
Results: We observed that the PFS and OS of the S-mole and D-mole groups failed
to reach a significant difference. However, D-his BBC patients enjoyed longer PFS
than their S-his counterparts, although the OS was similar. To explore the reason
for the extended PFS in D-his BBC patients, we first focused on the possible
prognostic contribution by various histopathological subtypes in the groups. We
compared the proportion of infiltrating ductal carcinoma, infiltrating lobular
carcinoma, and other breast cancer subtypes in the D-his and S-his groups, and
demonstrated that they were not associated with longer PFS. We then examined age,
menopausal status, tumor, node, and metastasis (TNM) stage, expressions of
estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR) and Ki67, and metastasis to
lymph nodes, viscera, and bone. The results indicated no significant
between-group differences in age, TNM stage, ER/PR expression, and metastasis to 
viscera and bone. However, significantly lower levels of Ki67and decreased lymph 
node metastasis rate were associated with D-his BBC patients, which might explain
the observed longer PFS.
Conclusions: In comparison to S-his, D-his BBC patients had longer PFS, which was
associated with lower levels of Ki67 and a decreased lymph node metastasis rate.

Folate-receptor-positive circulating tumor cells as an efficacious biomarker for 
the diagnosis of small pulmonary nodules.

Author information:

Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, Chengdu, Sichuan, China.

Objective: The objective of this study is to investigate the clinical
significance of folate-receptor-positive circulating tumor cells (FR+CTC) for the
diagnosis of lung cancer, especially in early-stage patients.
Materials and Methods: A total of 72 lung cancer patients, including 31 with
stage I diseases and two with stage 0 diseases, were enrolled in this study.
Twenty-four patients with benign lung diseases and two healthy volunteers served 
as the control group. Three milliliters of peripheral blood were collected from
each participant for FR+CTC analysis on enrollment. FR+CTC enumeration was
performed using immunomagnetic leukocyte depletion and ligand-targeted polymerase
chain reaction techniques.
Results: The study results revealed that using a cutoff value of 8.7 CTC Units/3 
mL, the sensitivity, and specificity of FR+CTC for diagnosis of lung cancer were 
81.94% and 73.08%, respectively. Such high sensitivity (74.19%) and specificity
(73.08%) persisted even if only stage I lung cancer patients were retained in the
analysis. In receiver operating characteristic analysis, the performance of
FR+CTC (area under the curve = 0.8153) was superior to other clinical biomarkers 
such as carcinoembryonic antigen, neuron-specific enolase, and cytokeratin 19
fragments. In a subgroup analysis, patients with nodule size of >3 cm showed an
improved sensitivity (88.46%); although, the specificity appeared to decrease
(40%). All five patients with benign diseases in this subgroup had inflammatory
diseases, indicating that large inflammatory nodules may also release FR
-expressing cells into the circulatory system.
Conclusion: FR+CTC is a reliable biomarker for the early diagnosis of small-sized
lung cancer. Further study with larger sample size is required to assess the
diagnostic efficiency of FR+CTC in patients with large nodule sizes.

Fujian Province, Mengchao Hepatobiliary Hospital of Fujian Medical University,
Fuzhou, China.

Background: Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) causes death mainly by disseminated
metastasis progression and major challenge of clinical management is to
distinguish lethal metastatic stage from indolent stage. It is shown that
metastatic progression is closely related to cellular metabolism. But detailed
metabolic alterations and molecular mechanisms still kept unclear between
subtypes of different lung metastatic potentials. Methods: The current work used 
NMR-based metabolomics in the study of HCC cells with high malignancy but
differed in lung metastatic potentials. Cell extracts and cultured media from
MHCC97L and MHCC97H were utilized to reveal metabolic alterations related to
metastatic potentials. Multivariate analyses were performed to identify
characteristic metabolites which were used subsequently to draw the map of
relative biochemical pathways by combining KEGG database. Results: The NMR
spectra of both MHCC97L and MHCC97H include various signals from necessary
nutritional components and metabolic intermediates. A series of characteristic
metabolites were determined from both cell extracts and media. The ability on
nutrient uptake varied from cell lines. Most of amino acids decreased in high
metastatic cell line, so altered amino acid metabolisms and energy metabolism
were revealed in high metastatic MHCC97H cell line. The majority pathways
involved six essential amino acids in which the observed branched-chain amino
acids together with lysine contributed to biosynthesis or degradation. Basically 
MHCC97H cell line could induce more active events than that of MHCC97L to
progress to high metastasis with certain molecular events. Characteristic
metabolites-derived classifiers performed robustly during prediction and
confirmed their critical role in supporting metastasis progression. Conclusions: 
Our results provide evidence that NMR-metabolomics analyses of cells are able to 
understand metastatic characteristics accountable for biological properties. The 
proposed characteristic metabolites will help to understand HCC metastatic
characterizations and may be filtered as potential biomarkers.

Purpose: Eukaryotic initiation factor 4A-3 (EIF4A3) is an RNA-binding protein
(RBP) that is a core component of the exon junction complex (EJC). It has been
identified as an important player in post-transcriptional regulation processes.
Recently, investigations have focused on EIF4A3 dysfunction in carcinogenesis.
The present study aims to determine whether EIF4A3 can serve as a prognostic
marker and potential regulatory mechanism in human cancers. Materials and
methods: EIF4A3 expression in various cancers was assessed using Oncomine. The
Correlation between EIF4A3 expression and patient survival was evaluated using
PrognoScan. EIF4A3 mutations in various cancers were investigated using
cBioPortal. EIF4A3 co-expression networks in various cancers were established
using Coexpedia. Finally, we analyzed potential functional roles of EIF4A3 using 
Gene Ontology and pathway enrichment analyses by FunRich V3. Results: EIF4A3 was 
overexpressed in common malignancies at the transcription levels. High incidences
of the breast, lung, and urinary cancers were closely related to the prognostic
index for survival. The most prevalent mutation in EIF4A3 was E59K/Q. The tumor
necrosis factor-α (TNF-α)/nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) signaling pathway was
affected by these mutations. Co-expression networks showed that EIF4A3 regulates 
apoptosis and cell cycle via several cancer-related signal pathways, and promotes
tumor cell migration, invasion and drug resistance. Conclusion: Our results
suggest the potential role for EIF4A3 to serve as a diagnostic marker or
therapeutic target for certain types of cancers.

Background and aim: Adenocarcinoma is a very common pathological subtype for lung
cancer. We aimed to identify the gene signature associated with the prognosis of 
smoking related lung adenocarcinoma using bioinformatics analysis. Methods: A
total of five gene expression profiles (GSE31210, GSE32863, GSE40791, GSE43458
and GSE75037) have been identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using GEO2R
software and functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the overall
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) have been validated using an
independent cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Results: We
identified a total of 58 DEGs which mainly enriched in ECM-receptor interaction, 
platelet activation and PPAR signaling pathway. Then according to the enrichment 
analysis results, we selected three genes (AURKA, CDC20 and TPX2) for their roles
in regulating tumor cell cycle and cell division. The results showed that the
hazard ratio (HR) of the mRNA expression of AURKA for OS was 1.588 with
(1.127-2.237) 95% confidence interval (CI) (P=0.009). The mRNA levels of CDC20
(HR 1.530, 95% CI 1.086-2.115, P=0.016) and TPX2 (HR 1.777, 95%CI 1.262-2.503,
P=0.001) were also significantly associated with the OS. Expression of these
three genes were not associated with RFS, suggesting that there might be many
factors affect RFS. Conclusion: The mRNA signature of AURKA, CDC20 and TPX2 were 
potential biomarkers for predicting poor prognosis of smoking related lung
adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Red cell distribution width (RDW) has been reported to reflect
the inflammation and nutrition status and predict prognosis of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with anti-programmed cell death-1 (PD-1)
antibody. The aim of this study was to analyze the correlation between RDW and
prognosis of NSCLC patients.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We collected retrospective data on consecutive NSCLC
patients treated with anti-PD-1 antibody from December 2015 to April 2018 at the 
Kobe University Hospital, Japan.
RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were treated. Patients with RDW ≥16% had a
significantly shorter OS (p=0.010) compared to those with RDW <16%. In
multivariate analysis, RDW ≥16% was an independent factor predicting poor
prognosis (p=0.019).
CONCLUSION: Pre-treatment RDW ≥16% is an indicator of poor prognosis. RDW is an
inexpensive, convenient, and routinely available marker of prognosis.

High and low mutational burden tumors versus immunologically hot and cold tumors 
and response to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

Tumors responding to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have a higher level of
immune infiltrates and/or an Interferon (IFN) signature indicative of a
T-cell-inflamed phenotype. Melanoma and lung cancer demonstrate high response
rates to ICIs and are commonly referred to as "hot tumors". These are in sharp
contrast to tumors with low immune infiltrates called "cold tumors" or
non-T-cell-inflamed cancers, such as those from the prostate and pancreas.
Classification of tumors based on their immune phenotype can partially explain
clinical response to ICIs. However, this model alone cannot fully explain the
lack of response among many patients treated with ICIs.Dichotomizing tumors based
on their mutation profile into high tumor mutation burden (TMB) or low TMB, such 
as many childhood malignancies, can also, to some extent, explain the clinical
response to immunotherapy. This model mainly focuses on a tumor's genotype rather
than its immune phenotype. High TMB tumors often have higher levels of
neoantigens that can be recognized by the immune system. In the current era of
immunotherapy, with the lack of definitive biomarkers, we need to evaluate tumors
based on both their immune phenotype and genomic mutation profile to determine
which patients have a higher likelihood of responding to treatment with ICIs.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), largely remains a primary cause of
cancer-related death worldwide. The molecular mechanisms in LUAD metastasis have 
not been completely uncovered.
METHODS: In this study, we identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs),
miRNAs (DEMs) and lncRNAs (DELs) underlying metastasis of LUAD from The Cancer
Genome Atlas database. Intersection mRNAs were used to perform gene ontology
(GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway and co-expression
network analysis. In addition, survival analyses of intersection mRNAs were
conducted. Finally, intersection mRNAs, miRNAs and lncRNAs were subjected to
construct miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA network.
RESULTS: A total of 1015 DEGs, 54 DEMs and 22 DELs were identified in LUAD
metastasis and non-metastasis samples. GO and KEGG pathway analysis had proven
that the functions of intersection mRNAs were closely related with many important
processes in cancer pathogenesis. Among the co-expression interactions network,
22 genes in the co-expression network were over the degree 20. These genes imply 
that they have connections with many other gene nodes. In addition, 14 target
genes (ARHGAP11A, ASPM, HELLS, PRC1, TMPO, ARHGAP30, CD52, IL16, IRF8, P2RY13,
PRKCB, PTPRC, SASH3 and TRAF3IP3) were found to be associated with survival in
patients with LUAD significantly (log-rank P < 0.05). Two lncRNAs (LOC96610 and
ADAM6) acting as ceRNAs were identified based on the miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA network.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results may provide a novel perspective to
develop a multiple gene diagnostic tool for LUAD prognosis, which might also
provide potential biomarkers or therapeutic targets for LUAD.

Currently, platinum-based chemotherapy is the standard first-line treatment for
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that is not driven by identifiable
genetic events, such as sensitizing mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) and translocations of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK). Immune checkpoint 
inhibitors, which unleash a patient's own T cells to attack tumors, are
revolutionizing the treatment paradigm of lung cancer. Anti-programmed death 1
(anti-PD-1) antibodies, pembrolizumab and nivolumab, and anti-programmed death
ligand 1 (anti-PD-L1) antibody atezolizumab have shown a significantly longer
survival and manageable safety profile, being approved as first or second-line
treatment options in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Only the 
pembrolizumab approval is limited to the PD-L1-positive NSCLC; both nivolumab and
atezolizumab can be currently used irrespective of tumor PD-L1 expression.
Biomarkers for the response to PD-1/PD-LI checkpoint inhibitors beyond PD-L1
expression levels are being investigated in order to select patients who are most
likely to benefit from antibodies targeting the PD-1 axis.

The current state of proteomics requires a choice between targeted and global
discovery methods. A method, that combines targeted and data-independent
acquisition for absolute quantification of all identified plasma proteins, in a
single sequential window acquisition of all theoretical fragment ions (SWATH)
acquisition run, using a panel of spike-in standards (SIS), is established and
optimized. The absolute quantification (AQ) of SWATH and multiple-reaction
monitoring-high resolution (MRM-HR) acquisition methods are compared using the
100 protein PlasmaDive SIS panel spiked into non-depleted human plasma. SWATH
provides equivalent quantification and differentially abundant protein profiles
as MRM-HR. Absolute quantities of the SIS peptides from the SWATH data are used
to estimate the absolute quantities (eAQ) for all the proteins in the run. The
eAQ values provide similar quantification and differentially abundant protein
profiles as AQ and protein area (PA) values. As a proof-of-concept, the eAQ
method is applied to 12 plasma samples from six non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients and the performance of eAQ values versus peak area
quantification is evaluated. There is a strong correlation between AQ and peak
area ratios producing significant overlap of differentially abundant proteins.
This eAQ method can provide quantitative data equivalent to AQ or peak area
values.

BACKGROUND: Anlotinib has been demonstrated in clinical trials to be effective in
prolonging the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of
refractory advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms and predictive biomarkers of anlotinib are still 
unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of anlotinib administered to 294 NSCLC patients
was performed to screen for underlying biomarkers of anlotinib-responsive
patients. Transcriptome and functional assays were performed to understand the
antitumour molecular mechanisms of anlotinib. Changes in serum CCL2 levels were
analysed to examine the correlation of the anlotinib response between responders 
and nonresponders.
RESULTS: Anlotinib therapy was beneficial for prolonging OS in NSCLC patients
harbouring positive driver gene mutations, especially patients harbouring the
epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)T790M mutation. Moreover, anlotinib
inhibited angiogenesis in an NCI-H1975-derived xenograft model via inhibiting
CCL2. Finally, anlotinib-induced serum CCL2 level decreases were associated with 
the benefits of PFS and OS in refractory advanced NSCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a novel anti-angiogenesis mechanism of anlotinib
via inhibiting CCL2 in an NCI-H1975-derived xenograft model and suggests that
changes in serum CCL2 levels may be used to monitor and predict clinical outcomes
in anlotinib-administered refractory advanced NSCLC patients using third-line
therapy or beyond.

BACKGROUND: The majority of cancer-related deaths are due to lung cancer, and
there is a need for reliable diagnostic biomarkers to predict stages in non-small
cell lung cancer cases. Recently, microRNAs were found to have potential as both 
biomarkers and therapeutic targets for lung cancer. However, some of the
microRNA's functions are unknown, and their roles in cancer stage progression
have been mostly undiscovered in this clinically and genetically heterogeneous
disease. As evidence suggests that microRNA dysregulations are implicated in many
diseases, it is essential to consider the changes in microRNA-target regulation
across different lung cancer subtypes.
RESULTS: We proposed a pipeline to identify microRNA synergistic modules with
similar dysregulation patterns across multiple subtypes by constructing the
MicroRNA Dysregulational Synergistic Network. From the network, we extracted
microRNA modules and incorporated them as prior knowledge to the Sparse Group
Lasso classifier. This leads to a more relevant selection of microRNA biomarkers,
thereby improving the cancer stage classification accuracy. We applied our method
to the TCGA Lung Adenocarcinoma and the Lung Squamous Cell Carcinoma datasets. In
cross-validation tests, the area under ROC curve rate for the cancer stages
prediction has increased considerably when incorporating the learned microRNA
dysregulation modules. The extracted modules from multiple independent subtypes
differential analyses were found to have high agreement with microRNA family
annotations, and they can also be used to identify mutual biomarkers between
different subtypes. Among the top-ranked candidate microRNAs selected by the
model, 87% were reported to be related to Lung Adenocarcinoma. The overall result
demonstrates that clustering microRNAs from the dysregulation pattern between
microRNAs and their targets leads to biomarkers with high precision and recall
rate to known differentially expressed disease-associated microRNAs.
CONCLUSIONS: The results indicated that our method improves microRNA biomarker
selection by detecting similar microRNA dysregulational synergistic patterns
across the multiple subtypes. Since microRNA-target dysregulations are implicated
in many cancers, we believe this tool can have broad applications for discovery
of novel microRNA biomarkers in heterogeneous cancer diseases.

In recent decades, technical advances in surgery and radiotherapy, as well as
breakthroughs in the knowledge on cancer biology, have helped to substantially
improve the standard of cancer care with respect to overall response rates,
progression-free survival, and the quality of life of cancer patients. In this
context, immunotherapy is thought to have revolutionized the standard of care for
cancer patients in the long term. For example, immunotherapy approaches such as
immune checkpoint blockade are currently increasingly being used in cancer
treatment, either alone or in combination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and 
there is hope from the first clinical trials that the appropriate integration of 
immunotherapy into standard care will raise the success rates of cancer therapy
to a new level. Nevertheless, successful cancer therapy remains a major
challenge, particularly in tumors with either pronounced resistance to
chemotherapy and radiation treatment, a high risk of normal tissue complications,
or both, as in lung cancer. Chemotherapy, radiotherapy and immunotherapy have the
capacity to evoke adverse effects in normal tissues when administered alone.
However, therapy concepts are usually highly complex, and it is still not clear
if combining immunotherapy with radio(chemo)therapy will increase the risk of
normal tissue complications, in particular since normal tissue toxicity induced
by chemotherapy and radiotherapy can involve immunologic processes.
Unfortunately, no reliable biomarkers are available so far that are suited to
predict the unique normal tissue sensitivity of a given patient to a given
treatment. Consequently, clinical trials combining radiotherapy and immunotherapy
are attracting major attention, not only regarding efficacy, but also with regard
to safety. In the present review, we summarize the current knowledge of
radiation-induced and immunotherapy-induced effects in tumor and normal tissue of
the lung, and discuss the potential limitations of combined radio-immunotherapy
in lung cancer with a focus on the suspected risk for enhanced acute and chronic 
normal tissue toxicity.

Inhalation exposure to atmospheric polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is
posing a great threat to human health. Biomass combustion in rural areas
contributes greatly to the total PAH emission in China. To conduct a
comprehensive risk assessment of ambient PAHs in rural China, a nationwide air
sampling campaign was carried out in this study. The 16 U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency priority PAHs in tree bark, which was employed as a passive air
sampler, were analyzed. The summation of the 16 PAHs ranged from 11.7 to
12,860 ng/m3 in the air of rural China. The national median benzo(a)pyrene
equivalent (BaPeq) concentration was 18.4 ng/m3, with the range from 0.334 to
2497 ng/m3. The total inhalation carcinogenic risks of individual PAHs, with the 
exception for naphthalene, were very low (<1 × 10-6) at most of the sampling
sites. The national median excess lifetime lung cancer risk associated with
inhalation exposure to atmospheric PAHs was 20.3 × 10-6, corresponding to a
population attributable fraction (PAF) of 3.38‰. Our estimations using tree bark 
were comparable to those reported in other studies and the uncertainties of the
variables in the dataset were within the acceptable levels, demonstrating that
tree bark is feasible for assessing the atmospheric PAH pollution and associated 
health risks. We feel that the outputs from this study can assist decision-makers
focusing on protecting human health against exposure to atmospheric PAHs in rural
China.

BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Radiation therapy (RT) for breast cancer after
conservative surgery can be life-saving but remains associated with significant
late side effects, including lung fibrosis, detected by chest CT. Aim of this
study was to assess whether lung ultrasound (LUS) may detect late lung fibrosis
through the biomarker of B-lines.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated 30 women (median age 67 years, range 46-80
years) about 3-8 years after RT (follow up 38-101 months, median 58 months) for
left (n = 12) or right (n = 18) breast cancer (stage 1, n = 24; stage 2, n = 6), 
treated with total dose 40.5 - 50.00 Gy with/without boost dose). In all, both
treated and contralateral hemithorax were evaluated. LUS was performed and
B-lines evaluated with a 28-region antero-lateral scan, from second to fifth
intercostal spaces, along the mid-axillary, anterior axillary, mid-clavicular,
and parasternal lines. In each space, the B-lines were counted from 0 = black
lung to 10 = white lung. The sum of B-lines in all spaces generated the B-line
score of each hemithorax.
RESULTS: Median B-line score was higher in the irradiated site than in the
contralateral control hemithorax (9, 1st-3rd quartiles: 2-23 vs 3, 1st-3rd
quartiles: 1-4; P < 0.05). In the treated hemithorax, higher mean lung doses ( > 
median value of 2.7 Gy) were associated with more B-lines when compared to lower 
doses (< 2.7 Gy): 9 vs 5, p <0.001.
CONCLUSION: RT in female breast cancer survivors is associated with increase in
B-lines in the targeted hemithorax, likely due to lung fibrosis, and related to
the lung mean dose. LUS can provide a simple "echo-marker" of lung fibrosis.

To study the relationship between Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine
(SPARC), Transforming growth factorβ1 (TGFβ1), Endoglin and angiogenesis in lung 
cancer, 40 cases of lung cancer specimens and 40 adjacent normal lung tissues
specimens were collected and 10 cases from each were selected for preparation of 
tissue chip. CD34 (endothelial cell marker), Endoglin human α-Smooth muscle
actin, and (α-SMA) markers were performed by immunohistochemical staining, and
the immuno-phenotype and the relationship between different morphologies of the
microvascular wall components were evaluated. The expression of SPARC mRNA and
protein, TGFβ1 mRNA and protein and Endoglin in the remaining 30 cases of lung
cancer were detected by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization. The
result shows that the positive rates of SPARC, TGFβ1 and Endoglin in lung cancer 
tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal lung tissues (P
less than 0.05). The expression of SPARC and TGFβ1 was negatively correlated with
lung cancer. When the positive expression of SPARC increased, the micro-vessel
density (MVD) marked by Endoglin decreased gradually; while the positive
expression of TGFβ1 increased, MVD increased gradually, and SPARC, TGFβ1 and MVD 
were correlated (P less than0.05). High SPARC mRNA expression in lung cancer
tissues could inhibit the progression of lung cancer, while high TGFβ1 mRNA
expression can promote the progression of lung cancer and participate in the
metastasis of lung cancer. To sum up, the angiogenesis of lung cancer may be
related to the interaction of SPARC, TGFβ1 and Endoglin.

Lung cancer is the most frequently occurring malignancy and the leading cause of 
cancer-related death for men in our country. The only recommended screening
method is clinic based low-dose computed tomography (also called a low-dose CT
scan, or LDCT). However, the effect of LDCT on overall mortality observed in lung
cancer patients is not statistically significant. Over-diagnosis, excessive cost,
risks associated with radiation exposure, false positive results and delay in the
commencement of the treatment procedure questions the use of LDCT as a reliable
technique for population-based screening. Therefore, identification of
minimal-invasive biomarkers able to detect malignancies at an early stage might
be useful to reduce the disease burden. Circulating nucleic acids are emerging as
important source of information for several chronic pathologies including lung
cancer. Of these, circulating cell free miRNAs are reported to be closely
associated with the clinical outcome of lung cancer patients. Smaller size,
sequence homology between species, low concentration and stability are some of
the major challenges involved in characterization and specific detection of
miRNAs. To circumvent these problems, synthesis of a quantum dot based
nano-biosensor might assist in sensitive, specific and cost-effective detection
of differentially regulated miRNAs. The wide excitation and narrow emission
spectra of these nanoparticles result in excellent fluorescent quantum yields
with a broader color spectrum which make them ideal bio-entities for fluorescence
resonance energy transfer (FRET) based detection for sequential or simultaneous
study of multiple targets. In addition, photo-resistance and higher stability of 
these nanoparticles allows extensive exposure and offer state-of-the art
sensitivity for miRNA targeting. A major obstacle for integrating QDs into
clinical application is the QD-associated toxicity. However, the use of non-toxic
shells along with surface modification not only overcomes the toxicity issues,
but also increases the ability of QDs to quickly detect circulating cell free
miRNAs in a non-invasive mode. The present review illustrates the importance of
circulating miRNAs in lung cancer diagnosis and highlights the translational
prospects of developing QD-based nano-biosensor for rapid early disease
detection.

TMEM Proteins in Cancer: A Review.

Schmit K(1), Michiels C(1).

Author information: 
(1)URBC-NARILIS, University of Namur, Namur, Belgium.

A transmembrane protein (TMEM) is a type of protein that spans biological
membranes. Many of them extend through the lipid bilayer of the plasma membrane
but others are located to the membrane of organelles. The TMEM family gathers
proteins of mostly unknown functions. Many studies showed that TMEM expression
can be down- or up-regulated in tumor tissues compared to adjacent healthy
tissues. Indeed, some TMEMs such as TMEM48 or TMEM97 are defined as potential
prognostic biomarkers for lung cancer. Furthermore, experimental evidence
suggests that TMEM proteins can be described as tumor suppressors or oncogenes.
TMEMs, such as TMEM45A and TMEM205, have also been implicated in tumor
progression and invasion but also in chemoresistance. Thus, a better
characterization of these proteins could help to better understand their
implication in cancer and to allow the development of improved therapy strategies
in the future. This review gives an overview of the implication of TMEM proteins 
in cancer.

Background: CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) is frequently overexpressed in a
variety of tumors. Nevertheless, whether CXCR7 can be used as a tumor prognosis
marker has not been systematically assessed. The current meta-analysis was
performed to obtain an accurate evaluation of the relationship between CXCR7
level and the prognosis of cancer patients.
Methods: Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched
according to a defined search strategy up to June 11, 2018. Then, the required
data were extracted from all qualified studies which were screened out based on
the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the hazard ratios (HR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the prognostic
significance of CXCR7 in tumor patients.
Results: A total of 28 original research studies comprising 33 cohorts and 5685
patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that CXCR7
overexpression was significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) (HR 1.72;
95% CI 1.49-1.99), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 5.58; 95% CI 3.16-9.85),
progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.66-4.85) and recurrence-free
survival (RFS) (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.34-1.88) in cancer patients. Furthermore, for
certain types of cancer, significant associations between higher CXCR7 expression
and worse OS of glioma (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.43-2.19), breast cancer (HR 1.45; 95%
CI 1.28-1.63), esophageal cancer (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.11-6.66) and pancreatic
cancer (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.12-1.90) were found. However, for lung cancer and
hepatocellular cancer, there was no significant relationship between CXCR7
expression level and OS, (HR 2.40; 95% CI 0.34-17.07) and (HR 1.37; 95% CI
0.84-2.24) respectively.
Conclusions: Increased CXCR7 level could predict poor prognosis of tumor patients
and might be regarded as a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor patients.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is a heterogeneous disease with poorer
outcomes compared to other breast cancer subtypes. Contributing to the worse
prognosis in TNBC is the higher rates of relapse and rapid progression after
relapse. Advances in targeted therapeutics and conventional chemotherapy for TNBC
have been stymied due to the lack of specific targets. Moreover, the responses to
chemotherapy in TNBC lack durability, partially accounting for the higher rates
of relapse. Immunotherapy, notably immune-checkpoint blockade, has shown to
improve survival and maintain robust antitumor responses in both hematologic and 
solid malignancies. Unlike lung cancer, melanoma, and bladder cancer, most breast
cancers are not inherently immunogenic and typically have low T cell
infiltration. However, among breast cancer subtypes, TNBC is characterized by
greater tumor immune infiltrate and higher degree of stromal and intratumoral
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), a predictive marker for responses to
immunotherapy. Moreover, in TNBC, the high number of stromal TILs is predictive
of more favorable survival outcomes and response to chemotherapy. Immunotherapy
is being extensively explored in TNBC and clinical trials are showing some
promising results. This article focuses on the rationale for immunotherapy in
TNBC, to explore and discuss preclinical data, results from early clinical
trials, and to summarize some ongoing trials. We will also discuss the potential 
application of immunotherapy in TNBC from a clinician's perspective.

BACKGROUND: Ventana ALK (D5F3) screening of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene
rearrangement in tissue specimens has been approved by US FDA (Food and Drug
Administration) to select treatment for non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
However, tumor tissues are often not readily obtainable, and cytology specimens
and may be the only tumor material available for diagnosis and molecular marker
analysis. In this study, we evaluated the feasibility of ALK immunocytochemistry 
(ICC) on ThinPrep slides and determined a suitable scoring system for
interpretation of the results.
METHODS: One hundred twenty-one fine-needle aspirate (FNA) specimens from
metastatic lesions of NSCLC were analyzed. ALK rearrangement was detected on
ThinPrep cytology slides using the Ventana immunocytochemistry ALK-D5F3 system,
which adopts two scoring systems for interpretation of the ICC results. The
results were subsequently confirmed by reverse transcription polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) analysis and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
RESULTS: Among the 121 ICC specimens, 16 that were considered ALK-positive by
either scoring system were referred for PCR analysis. Among the ALK ICC-negative 
cases, 33 had correlated FISH ALK results. A total of 49 specimens that exhibited
either a positive or negative ICC result with a correlated ALK status were
analyzed statistically. ICC results showed a high concordance rate with the
results of PCR/FISH analysis. The sensitivity and specificity of ALK ICC by the
binary scoring algorithm were 68.75 and 96.97%, respectively. These values
increased to 93.75 and 96.97%, respectively, when interpreted by the
semiquantified interpretation system.
CONCLUSIONS: ALK ICC analysis on ThinPrep slides is a reliable ALK testing
method, and the semiquantified interpretation system on cytology specimens is
recommended rather than the binary scoring algorithm on tissue specimens.

Forty percent of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients develop brain
metastases, resulting in a dismal prognosis. However, patients in an
oligo-metastatic brain disease setting seem to have better outcomes. Here, we
investigate the possibility of using circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as biomarkers
to differentiate oligo-metastatic patients for better risk assessment. Using the 
CellSearch® system, few CTCs were detected among NSCLC patients with brain
metastases (n = 52, 12.5% ≥ two and 8.9% ≥ five CTC/7.5 mL blood) and especially 
oligo-metastatic brain patients (n = 34, 5.9%, and 2.9%). Still, thresholds of
both ≥ two and ≥ five CTCs were independent prognostic indicators for shorter
overall survival time among all of the NSCLC patients (n = 90, two CTC ≥ HR:
1.629, p = 0.024, 95% CI: 1.137⁻6.465 and five CTC ≥ HR: 2.846, p = 0.0304, CI:
1.104⁻7.339), as well as among patients with brain metastases (two CTC ≥ HR:
4.694, p = 0.004, CI: 1.650⁻13.354, and five CTC ≥ HR: 4.963, p = 0.003, CI:
1.752⁻14.061). Also, oligo-brain NSCLC metastatic patients with CTCs had a very
poor prognosis (p = 0.019). Similarly, in other tumor entities, only 9.6% of
patients with brain metastases (n = 52) had detectable CTCs. Our data indicate
that although patients with brain metastases more seldom harbor CTCs, they are
still predictive for overall survival, and CTCs might be a useful biomarker to
identify oligo-metastatic NSCLC patients who might benefit from a more intense
therapy.

Primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma presenting as a thick-walled cystic mass
resembling a liver abscess: A case report.

Hospital, College of Medicine, Zhejiang University, the People's Hospital of
Beilun District, Ningbo.

Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

RATIONALE: Hepatic leiomyosarcoma is a rare malignant tumor, and in rare
instances, its combination with fever may lead to misdiagnosis of liver abscess. 
In our case, the presence of the tumor was considered by the presence of blood
vessels through the observation of hepatic tumor wall.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 38-year-old woman who had been diagnosed with a liver abscess
in a local hospital consulted our institution by complaining left upper quadrant 
pain and fever. The diagnosis was questioned in our workup, since no obvious
inflammatory marker was found in the circulation, and contrast-enhanced computed 
tomography revealed a huge thick-walled mass in the right liver with multiple
tortuous vessels within the wall.
DIAGNOSIS: Imaging revealed a neoplastic lesion rather than liver abscess. The
enhancement of the solid tumor tissues was reduced during the portal phase and
delayed phase, which was consistent with a wash-out enhancement. The
histopathologic and immunohistochemical results confirmed the diagnosis was
primary hepatic leiomyosarcoma. A pulmonary nodule during the postoperative
follow-up was diagnosed as metastatic leiomyosarcoma tumor through surgery.
INTERVENTIONS: A right hepatectomy was performed to cure the hepatic mass. In the
follow-up, a metastatic tumor in the lung was resected, followed by chemotherapy.
OUTCOMES: Lung metastasis and liver recurrence occurred at 25 and 39 months after
liver surgery, respectively. Then the patient was lost to follow-up.
LESSONS: Leiomyosarcoma is associated with a dismal prognosis, but outcomes for
these patients may be improved by the combined surgical resection and
chemotherapy.

INTRODUCTION: The introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors heralded a new era
in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer. However, nivolumab, an anti-PD-1 
antibody, can cause serious adverse events that are mostly autoimmune related.
CASE PRESENTATION: A 58-year-old woman was treated with nivolumab as second-line 
therapy for stage IV adenocarcinoma. The patient developed a nivolumab-induced
recurrent pneumonitis preceding durable clinical remission after seven cycles of 
nivolumab. Although high-dose glucocorticosteroids were tapered to conform to
contemporary guidelines, recurring episodes of pneumonitis occurred without
nivolumab rechallenge. In addition, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) serum levels
were associated with treatment response, since CEA decline correlated with a near
complete radiological response and, conversely, elevated CEA serum levels were
associated with progressive disease.
CONCLUSIONS: In this case, we described recurrence of nivolumab-induced
pneumonitis as a serious adverse event in immune checkpoint inhibitors. Our case 
illustrates that immune-related adverse events may correlate with antitumour
activity, even after treatment discontinuation. In addition, this case suggests
the possible clinical utility of CEA serum levels for the assessment of (durable)
effects of immunotherapy.

Importance: Effective treatment options are limited for patients with advanced,
metastatic esophageal cancer progressing after 2 or more lines of systemic
therapy.
Objective: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab for patients with
advanced, metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) or advanced,
metastatic adenocarcinoma of the esophagus and gastroesophageal junction that
progressed after 2 or more lines of systemic therapy.
Design, Setting, and Participants: This phase 2, open-label, interventional,
single-arm study, KEYNOTE-180, enrolled 121 patients from January 12, 2016, to
March 21, 2017, from 57 sites in 10 countries. Patients had advanced, metastatic 
esophageal cancer that progressed after 2 or more lines of therapy and had
evaluable tumor samples for biomarkers.
Interventions: Pembrolizumab, 200 mg, was administered intravenously every 3
weeks until disease progression, unacceptable toxic effects, or study withdrawal,
for up to 2 years.
Main Outcomes and Measures: Primary end point was objective response rate per the
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors by central imaging review for all
patients.
Results: As of September 18, 2017, of 121 enrolled patients (100 men and 21
women; median age, 65 years [range, 33-87 years]), 18 (14.9%) had undergone 3 or 
more prior therapies, 63 (52.1%) had ESCC, and 58 (47.9%) had tumors positive for
programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1), defined as a combined positive score of 10 or 
higher assessed by immunohistochemistry. Median duration of follow-up was 5.8
months (range, 0.2-18.3 months). Objective response rate was 9.9% (95% CI,
5.2%-16.7%) among all patients (12 of 121), and median duration of response was
not reached (range, 1.9-14.4 months). Objective response rate was 14.3% (95% CI, 
6.7%-25.4%) among patients with ESCC (9 of 63), 5.2% (95% CI, 1.1%-14.4%) among
patients with adenocarcinoma (3 of 58), 13.8% (95% CI, 6.1%-25.4%) among patients
with PD-L1-positive tumors (8 of 58), and 6.3% (95% CI, 1.8%-15.5%) among
patients with PD-L1-negative tumors (4 of 63). Overall, 15 patients (12.4%) had
treatment-related grade 3 to 5 adverse events. Only 5 patients (4.1%)
discontinued treatment because of adverse events. There was 1 treatment-related
death from pneumonitis.
Conclusions and Relevance: Where effective treatment options are an unmet need,
pembrolizumab provided durable antitumor activity with manageable safety in
patients with heavily pretreated esophageal cancer. Phase 3 studies evaluating
pembrolizumab vs standard therapy for patients with esophageal cancer progressing
after first-line therapy or in combination with chemotherapy as first-line
therapy for patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic esophageal 
cancer are ongoing.

This study aimed to explore the correlation between survival and tumor
calcification in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer who received
cetuximab combined with chemotherapy. The study was a single-center retrospective
analysis that enrolled 111 patients who had received therapy between April 2011
and October 2016. Tumor calcification and treatment efficacy were evaluated
independently by radiologists on the basis of computed tomography scans. Clinical
characteristics and follow-up data were collected from electronic medical
records. Correlations between tumor calcification and clinical characteristics,
tumor response rate, and patient survival were analyzed. Among the 111 enrolled
patients, 27 had tumor calcification [27/111 (24.3%)]. The median
progression-free survival was significantly longer for patients with tumor
calcification than for those without calcification (9.3 vs. 6.2 months, P=0.022).
Patients with tumor calcification also had a higher objective response rate (55.6
vs. 31%, P=0.021) and better overall survival (21.9 vs. 16.5 months, P=0.084).
The correlation between calcification features and prognosis showed that patients
with an increasing number of calcifications after treatment had a significantly
longer median overall survival (22.9 vs. 9.1 months, P=0.033). Simultaneously,
new liver metastases and multiple calcifications also showed a trend toward
better overall survival. There were also no significant correlations between
clinical characteristics (sex, age, gene mutation, primary tumor location,
pathological type, blood test result) and survival (Supplementary Table 1,
Supplemental digital content 1, http://links.lww.com/ACD/A280). Tumor
calcification is associated with a better treatment outcome and is a potential
prognostic marker.

INTRODUCTION: High-resolution imaging is the gold standard to measure the
functional and biological features of bone lesions. Imaging markers have allowed 
the characterization both of tumour heterogeneity and metabolic data. Besides,
ongoing studies are evaluating a combined use of 'imaging markers', such as SUVs,
MATV, TLG, ADC from PET and MRI techniques respectively, and several 'biomarkers'
spanning from chemokine immune-modulators, such as PD-1, RANK/RANKL, CXCR4/CXCL12
to transcription factors, such as TP53, RB1, MDM2, RUNX family, EZH2, YY1, MAD2. 
Osteoimmunology may improve diagnosis and prognosis leading to precision medicine
in bone lesion treatment. Areas covered: We investigated modalities (molecular
and imaging approach) useful to identify bone lesions deriving both from primary 
bone tumours and from osteotropic tumours, which have a higher incidence,
prevalence and prognosis. Here, we summarized the recent advances in imaging
techniques and osteoimmunology biomarkers which could play a pivotal role in
personalized treatment. Expert commentary: Although imaging and molecular
integration could allow both early diagnosis and stratification of cancer
prognosis, large scale clinical trials will be necessary to translate pilot
studies in the current clinical setting.

AIM: We investigated melanoma-associated antigen A1 (MAGE-A1) expression in lung 
cancer tissues and its correlation with prognostic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, samples from 101 patients
with lung cancer were obtained between 2007 and 2014 and stained for MAGE-A1 by
immunohistochemistry. Correlation with prognostic factors was assessed by t test,
and χ 2 , and Pearson's tests.
RESULTS: Eighty non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 21 small-cell lung cancer 
specimens were stained for MAGE-A1. MAGE-A1 was detected more commonly in
adenocarcinomas and was expressed more frequently in male and patients >60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: MAGE-A1 was found in several lung cancer patients. MAGE-A1 was
expressed more commonly in NSCLC, elderly, and men. Further investigations are
needed to assess MAGE-A1 as potential cancer biomarkers.

An electrochemical cytosensor for the detection of the non-small-cell lung cancer
cell line A549 (NSCLC) had been developed. A microwave-hydrothermal method was
employed to prepare monodisperse colloidal carbon nanospheres (CNSs). Gold
nanoparticles (AuNPs) were placed on the surface of the colloidal CNSs by
self-assembly to obtain 3D-structured microspheres of the type CNS@AuNP. The
results of an MTT assay show the microspheres to possess good biocompatibility.
The CNS@AuNP nanocomposite was then placed, in a chitosan film, on a glassy
carbon electrode (GCE). The voltammetric signals and detection sensitivity are
significantly enhanced owing to the synergistic effect of CNSs and AuNPs. A
cytosensor was then obtained by immobilization of antibody against the
carcinoembryonic antigen (which is a biomarker for NSCLC) on the GCE via
crosslinking with glutaraldehyde. Hexacyanoferrate is used as an electrochemical 
probe, and the typical working voltage is 0.2 V (vs. SCE). If exposed to A549
cells, the differential pulse voltammetric signal decreases in the 4.2 × 10-1 to 
4.2 × 10-6 cells mL-1 concentration range, and the detection limit is 14 cells
mL-1 (at S/N = 3). Graphical abstract Schematic presentation of design strategy
and fabrication process of the electrochemical cytosensor for A549 cells. (CNS:

The interactions of microRNAs (miRNAs), transcription factors (TFs) and their
common target long non‑coding RNAs (lncRNAs) can lead to the production of
TF‑miRNA‑lncRNA (TML) network motifs. These motifs are functional regulators that
perform a wide range of biological processes, such as carcinogenesis. However,
TML network motifs have not been systematically identified, and their roles in
lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) are largely
unknown. In the present study, a computational integration approach was performed
using multiple sources in order to construct a global TML network for LUAD and
LUSC. The analysis revealed several dysregulated TML network motifs, which were
common between the two lung cancer subtypes or specific to a single cancer
subtype. In addition, functional analysis further indicated that the TML network 
motifs may potentially serve as putative biomarkers in LUAD and LUSC. The
associations between drug treatments and dysregulated TML network motifs were
also examined. Collectively, the present study elucidated the roles of TML
network motifs in LUAD and LUSC, which may be beneficial for understanding the
pathogenesis of lung cancer and its potential treatment.

Cancer-derived exosomes are considered a major driver of cancer-induced
pre-metastatic niche formation at foreign sites, but the mechanisms remain
unclear. Here, we show that miR-25-3p, a metastasis-promoting miRNA of colorectal
cancer (CRC), can be transferred from CRC cells to endothelial cells via
exosomes. Exosomal miR-25-3p regulates the expression of VEGFR2, ZO-1, occludin
and Claudin5 in endothelial cells by targeting KLF2 and KLF4, consequently
promotes vascular permeability and angiogenesis. In addition, exosomal miR-25-3p 
from CRC cells dramatically induces vascular leakiness and enhances CRC
metastasis in liver and lung of mice. Moreover, the expression level of miR-25-3p
from circulating exosomes is significantly higher in CRC patients with metastasis
than those without metastasis. Our work suggests that exosomal miR-25-3p is
involved in pre-metastatic niche formation and may be used as a blood-based
biomarker for CRC metastasis.

Although responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are initially
positive, 30%-40% of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors do not respond well to
EGFR-TKIs, and most lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations experience
relapse with resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify not only the
mechanisms underlying EGFR-TKI resistance, but also potentially novel therapeutic
targets and/or predictive biomarkers for EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We
found that the GPI-anchored protein semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A) is highly induced by
the EGFR pathway, via mTOR signaling, and that expression levels of SEMA7A in
human lung adenocarcinoma specimens were correlated with mTOR activation.
Investigations using cell culture and animal models demonstrated that loss or
overexpression of SEMA7A made cells less or more resistant to EGFR-TKIs,
respectively. The resistance was due to the inhibition of apoptosis by aberrant
activation of ERK. The ERK signal was suppressed by knockdown of integrin β1
(ITGB1). Furthermore, in patients with EGFR mutant tumors, higher SEMA7A
expression in clinical samples predicted poorer response to EGFR-TKI treatment.
Collectively, these data show that the SEMA7A-ITGB1 axis plays pivotal roles in
EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by ERK activation and apoptosis inhibition.
Moreover, our results reveal the potential utility of SEMA7A not only as a
predictive biomarker, but also as a potentially novel therapeutic target in
EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

Early detection of lung cancer offers an important opportunity to decrease
mortality while it is still treatable and curable. Thirteen secretory proteins
that are Stat3 downstream gene products were identified as a panel of biomarkers 
for lung cancer detection in human sera. This panel of biomarkers potentially
differentiates different types of lung cancer for classification. Among them, the
transthyretin (TTR) concentration was highly increased in human serum of lung
cancer patients. TTR concentration was also induced in the serum, bronchoalveolar
lavage fluid, alveolar type II epithelial cells, and alveolar myeloid cells of
the CCSP-rtTA/(tetO)7-Stat3C lung tumor mouse model. Recombinant TTR stimulated
lung tumor cell proliferation and growth, which were mediated by activation of
mitogenic and oncogenic molecules. TTR possesses cytokine functions to stimulate 
myeloid cell differentiation, which are known to play roles in tumor environment.
Further analyses showed that TTR treatment enhanced the reactive oxygen species
production in myeloid cells and enabled them to become functional myeloid-derived
suppressive cells. TTR demonstrated a great influence on a wide spectrum of
endothelial cell functions to control tumor and immune cell migration and
infiltration. TTR-treated endothelial cells suppressed T cell proliferation.
Taken together, these 13 Stat3 downstream inducible secretory protein biomarkers 
potentially can be used for lung cancer diagnosis, classification, and as
clinical targets for lung cancer personalized treatment if their expression
levels are increased in a given lung cancer patient in the blood.

The identification of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients potentially
responsive to targeted therapies relies on a number of relevant biomarkers,
including EGFR, ALK, ROS-1, and PD-L1. Biomarker identification is most commonly 
based on surgical sample collection. However, when tissues are difficult to reach
or when multiple analyses are necessary to monitor tumor progression and
treatment response, liquid biopsy is a valid noninvasive alternative. This
analysis, which is preferentially performed on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
extracted from plasma samples, has the major advantage of reducing the inherent
risks and discomfort of tissue biopsy. However, a major disadvantage is that it
yields only a low number of ctDNA targets. Thus, to avoid false-positive and
false-negative results, it is important to adopt and validate technologies with
high sensitivity and specificity in the pre-analytical phase of sampling. This
review succinctly addresses the principal methodologies for analyzing
plasma-derived ctDNA in NSCLC patients.

Tumor biopsy is the gold standard for the assessment of clinical biomarkers for
treatment. However, tumors change dynamically in response to therapy, and there
remains a need for a more representative biomarker that can be assayed over the
course of treatment. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) may provide clinically
important and comprehensive tumoral information that is predictive of treatment
response and outcome. Blood samples were processed for CTCs from 56 patients
using the ClearCell FX system. Captured cells were phenotyped for CTC clusters
and markers for immunotherapy (PD-L1) CTC chromosomal architecture (ALK, EGFR).
CTCs were isolated in 11/23 (47.8%) of head and neck cancer (HNC) patients and
17/33 (51.5%) of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. CTCs were
determined to be PD-L1-positive in 6/11 (54.4%) HNC and 11/17 (64.7%) NSCLC
cases, respectively. 3D chromosomal DNA FISH for ALK and EGFR molecular targets
showed better resolution than in 2D when imaging CTCs. HNC CTC-positive patients 
had shorter progression-free survival (PFS) (hazard ratio[HR]: 4.946; 95%
confidence internal[CI]:1.571-15.57; P = 0.0063), and PD-L1-positive CTCs were
found to be significantly associated with worse outcome ([HR]:5.159; 95%
[CI]:1.011-26.33; P = 0.0485). In the advanced stage NSCLC patient cohort, PFS
was not found to be associated with CTCs prior to therapy ([HR]:2.246; 95%
[CI]:0.9565-5.273; P = 0.0632), nor the presence of PD-L1 expression ([HR]:1.646;
95% [CI]:0.5128-5.283; P = 0.4023). This study demonstrated that CTCs are
predictive of poorer outcomes in HNC and provides distinct and separate utility
for CTCs in HNC and NSCLC, which may be more representative of the disease burden
and overall survival than the parameters used to measure them.

Overexpression of chemokine receptor type 4 (CXCR4) has been found to be
associated with increased cell proliferation, metastasis and also act as an
indicator of poor prognosis in patients with breast cancer. Therefore, new agents
that can abrogate CXCR4 expression have potential against breast cancer
metastasis. In this study, we examined the potential effect of thymoquinone (TQ),
derived from the seeds of Nigella sativa, on the expression and regulation of
CXCR4 in breast cancer cells. TQ was found to inhibit the expression of CXCR4 in 
MDA-MB-231 triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) cells in a dose- and
time-dependent manner. It was noted that suppression of CXCR4 by TQ was possibly 
transcriptionally regulated, as treatment with this drug caused down-regulation
of nuclear factor kappa-light-chain-enhancer of activated B cells (NF-κB)
activation and suppression of NF-κB binding to the CXCR4 promoter. Pretreatment
with a proteasome inhibitor and/or lysosomal stabilization did not affect TQ
induced suppression of CXCR4. Down-regulation of CXCR4 was further correlated
with the inhibition of CXCL12-mediated migration and invasion of MDA-MB-231
cells. Interestingly, it was observed that the deletion of p65 could reverse the 
observed anti-invasive/anti-migratory effects of TQ in breast cancer cells. TQ
also dose-dependently inhibited MDA-MB-231 tumor growth and tumor vascularity in 
a chick chorioallantoic membrane assay model. We also observed TQ (2 and 4 mg/kg)
treatment significantly suppressed multiple lung, brain, and bone metastases in a
dose-dependent manner in a metastasis breast cancer mouse model. Interestingly,
H&E and immunohistochemical analysis of bone isolated from TQ treated mice
indicated a reduction in number of osteolytic lesions and the expression of
metastatic biomarkers. In conclusion, the results indicate that TQ primarily
exerts its anti-metastatic effects by down-regulation of NF-κB regulated CXCR4
expression and thus has potential for the treatment of breast cancer.

Because of the refractory nature of mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to
current therapies, identification of new molecular targets is essential. Genes
with a prognostic role in mutant KRAS LUAD have proven to be potential molecular 
targets for therapeutic development. Here we determine the clinical, functional, 
and mechanistic role of inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) in mutant KRAS LUAD.
Analysis of LUAD cohorts from TCGA and SPORE showed that high expression of Id1
was a marker of poor survival in patients harboring mutant, but not wild-type
KRAS. Abrogation of Id1 induced G2-M arrest and apoptosis in mutant KRAS LUAD
cells. In vivo, loss of Id1 strongly impaired tumor growth and maintenance as
well as liver metastasis, resulting in improved survival. Mechanistically, Id1
was regulated by the KRAS oncogene through JNK, and loss of Id1 resulted in
downregulation of elements of the mitotic machinery via inhibition of the
transcription factor FOSL1 and of several kinases within the KRAS signaling
network. Our study provides clinical, functional, and mechanistic evidence
underscoring Id1 as a critical gene in mutant KRAS LUAD and warrants further
studies of Id1 as a therapeutic target in patients with LUAD. SIGNIFICANCE: These
findings highlight the prognostic significance of the transcriptional regulator
Id1 in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and provide mechanistic insight into how
it controls tumor growth and metastasis.

Triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) commonly develops resistance to
chemotherapy, yet markers predictive of chemoresistance in this disease are
lacking. Here, we define WNT10B-dependent biomarkers for β-CATENIN/HMGA2/EZH2
signaling predictive of reduced relapse-free survival. Concordant expression of
HMGA2 and EZH2 proteins is observed in MMTV-Wnt10bLacZ transgenic mice during
metastasis, and Hmga2 haploinsufficiency decreased EZH2 protein expression,
repressing lung metastasis. A novel autoregulatory loop interdependent on HMGA2
and EZH2 expression is essential for β-CATENIN/TCF-4/LEF-1 transcription.
Mechanistically, both HMGA2 and EZH2 displaced Groucho/TLE1 from TCF-4 and served
as gatekeepers for K49 acetylation on β-CATENIN, which is essential for
transcription. In addition, we discovered that HMGA2-EZH2 interacts with the PRC2
complex. Absence of HMGA2 or EZH2 expression or chemical inhibition of Wnt
signaling in a chemoresistant patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of TNBC
abolished visceral metastasis, repressing AXIN2, MYC, EZH2, and HMGA2 expression 
in vivo. Combinatorial therapy of a WNT inhibitor with doxorubicin
synergistically activated apoptosis in vitro, resensitized PDX-derived cells to
doxorubicin, and repressed lung metastasis in vivo. We propose that targeting the
WNT10B biomarker network will provide improved outcomes for TNBC. SIGNIFICANCE:
These findings reveal targeting the WNT signaling pathway as a potential
therapeutic strategy in triple-negative breast cancer.Graphical Abstract:

Diagnostic Value of Autoantibodies in Lung Cancer: a Systematic Review and
Meta-Analysis.

Qin J, Zeng N, Yang T, Wan C, Chen L, Shen Y, Wen F.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Recently, many studies have demonstrated that various
tumor-associated autoantibodies have been detected in early stages of lung
cancer. Therefore, we conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively evaluate
available evidence on the diagnostic value of autoantibodies against
tumor-associated antigens in lung cancer.
METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and other
databases through 23 March 2018. Study quality was assessed using the Quality
Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies-2. We used the bivariate mixed-effect
models to calculate pooled values of sensitivity, specificity, positive
likelihood ratios, negative likelihood ratios, diagnostic odds ratios and
associated 95% confidence intervals. Summary receiver operating characteristic
(SROC) curves were used to summarize overall test performance. Deek's funnel plot
was used to detect publication bias.
RESULTS: Review of 468 candidate articles identified fifty-three articles with a 
total of 11,515 patients for qualitative review and meta-analysis. Pooled
sensitivity, specificity and area under the SROC curve were as follows for
tumor-associated autoantibodies against the following proteins: p53, 0.19, 0.98, 
0.82; NY-ESO-1, 0.17, 0.98, 0.90; Survivin, 0.19, 0.99, 0.96; c-myc, 0.14, 0.98, 
0.45; Cyclin B1, 0.18, 0.98, 0.91; GBU4-5, 0.07, 0.98, 0.91; CAGE, 0.14, 0.98,
0.90; p16, 0.08, 0.97, 0.91; SOX2, 0.14, 0.99, 0.93; and HuD, 0.17, 0.99, 0.82.
CONCLUSION: Each tumor-associated autoantibody on its own showed excellent
diagnostic specificity for lung cancer but inadequate sensitivity. Our results
suggest that combinations or panels of tumor-associated autoantibodies may
provide better sensitivity for diagnosing lung cancer, and the diagnostic
accuracy of tumor-associated autoantibodies should be validated in more studies.

BACKGROUND: Atezolizumab (anti-programmed death-ligand 1 [PD-L1]) received
approval from the US Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency
for previously treated advanced non-small-cell lung cancer based on OAK-a
randomised, phase III trial that showed significantly improved survival with
atezolizumab versus docetaxel regardless of PD-L1 expression. With longer
follow-up, we summarised the characteristics of long-term survivors (LTSs).
METHODS: In OAK (NCT02008227), patients were randomised 1:1 to receive
atezolizumab or docetaxel until loss of clinical benefit or disease progression, 
respectively. Overall survival was evaluated after a 26-month minimum follow-up, 
including in patient subgroups defined by best overall response (BOR). LTSs were 
defined as patients who lived ≥24 months since randomisation. Non-LTSs died
within 24 months, and patients censored before 24 months were excluded from the
analysis. The baseline characteristics, including biomarkers, BOR, subsequent
non-protocol therapy (NPT) and safety, are reported.
RESULTS: Survival benefit with atezolizumab was observed across all patient
subgroups defined by BOR. More atezolizumab-treated patients were LTSs versus
those treated with docetaxel (28% versus 18%). Most atezolizumab responders were 
LTSs (77%) versus only 48% of docetaxel responders. However, 21% of
atezolizumab-arm LTSs had progressive disease (PD) as BOR, and more
atezolizumab-arm LTSs than non-LTSs continued treatment post-PD. Fifty-two
percent of docetaxel-arm LTSs received immunotherapy as subsequent NPT. Despite
extended treatment duration in atezolizumab-arm LTSs (median, 18 months),
atezolizumab was well tolerated.
CONCLUSIONS: After >2 years of follow-up, atezolizumab continued to provide
durable survival benefit versus docetaxel, with tolerable safety.
Atezolizumab-arm LTSs were enriched for patients with high PD-L1 expression and
included PD-L1-negative patients. Long-term survival was not limited to
responders.

Activatable (turn-on) probes that permit the rapid, sensitive, selective, and
accurate identification of cancer-associated biomarkers can help drive advances
in cancer research. Herein, a NAD(P)H:quinone oxidoreductase-1 (NQO1)-specific
chemiluminescent probe 1 is reported that allows the differentiation between
cancer subtypes. Probe 1 incorporates an NQO1-specific trimethyl-locked quinone
trigger moiety covalently tethered to a phenoxy-dioxetane moiety through a
para-aminobenzyl alcohol linker. Bio-reduction of the quinone to the
corresponding hydroquinone results in a chemiluminescent signal. As inferred from
a combination of in vitro cell culture analyses and in vivo mice studies, the
probe is safe, cell permeable, and capable of producing a "turn-on" luminescence 
response in an NQO1-positive A549 lung cancer model. On this basis, probe 1 can
be used to identify cancerous cells and tissues characterized by elevated NQO1
levels.

Oxidative stress may be involved in carcinogenesis and biomarkers of oxidative
stress like derivatives of reactive oxygen metabolites (d-ROM) may be useful for 
cancer prediction. However, no previous study assessed the association of
pre-diagnostic d-ROM measurements with cancer incidence. We measured serum d-ROM 
levels in a cohort sample of n = 4,345 participants of the German ESTHER study
and in a case-cohort sample of the Norwegian Tromsø study (cancer cases: n = 941;
subcohort: n = 1,000). Moreover, d-ROM was repeatedly measured at follow-ups of
both studies. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were
derived by (weighted) multivariable-adjusted Cox regression with time-dependent
modeling of d-ROM levels for incident lung, colorectal, breast and prostate
cancer. Individual study results were pooled by random effects meta-analysis. The
HRs (95% CI) for comparison of top and bottom d-ROM tertile were statistically
significant for lung (1.90 [1.25-2.89]), colorectal (1.70 [1.15-2.51]) and breast
cancer incidence (1.45 [1.01-2.09]) but not for prostate cancer incidence (1.20
[0.84-1.72]). In conclusion, this individual participant data meta-analysis of
two large population-based cohort studies with repeated d-ROM measurements
yielded evidence for an involvement of high oxidative stress in carcinogenesis.
Given the observed associations of pre-diagnostic d-ROM measurements with lung,
colorectal and breast cancer incidence, subjects with increased serum d-ROM
levels should be recommended to reduce these levels by lifestyle changes
including smoking cessation, a healthy diet and an increase in physical activity.

BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with BRAF and MEK inhibitors significantly
improves survival in BRAF mutated melanoma patients but is unable to prevent
disease recurrence due to the emergence of drug resistance. Cancer stem cells
(CSCs) have been involved in these long-term treatment failures. We previously
reported in lung cancer that CSCs maintenance is due to altered lipid metabolism 
and dependent upon Stearoyl-CoA-desaturase (SCD1)-mediated upregulation of YAP
and TAZ. On this ground, we investigated the role of SCD1 in melanoma CSCs.
METHODS: SCD1 gene expression data of melanoma patients were downloaded from TCGA
and correlated with disease progression by bioinformatics analysis and confirmed 
on patient's tissues by qRT-PCR and IHC analyses. The effects of combination of
BRAF/MEKi and the SCD1 inhibitor MF-438 were monitored by spheroid-forming and
proliferation assays on a panel of BRAF-mutated melanoma cell lines grown in 3D
and 2D conditions, respectively. SCD1, YAP/TAZ and stemness markers were
evaluated in melanoma cells and tissues by qRT-PCR, WB and Immunofluorescence.
RESULTS: We first observed that SCD1 expression increases during melanoma
progression. BRAF-mutated melanoma 3D cultures enriched for CSCs overexpressed
SCD1 and were more resistant than 2D differentiated cultures to BRAF and MEK
inhibitors. We next showed that exposure of BRAF-mutated melanoma cells to MAPK
pathway inhibitors enhanced stemness features by upregulating the expression of
YAP/TAZ and downstream genes but surprisingly not SCD1. However, SCD1
pharmacological inhibition was able to downregulate YAP/TAZ and to revert at the 
same time CSC enrichment and resistance to MAPK inhibitors.
CONCLUSIONS: Our data underscore the role of SCD1 as prognostic marker in
melanoma and promote the use of SCD1 inhibitors in combination with MAPK
inhibitors for the control of drug resistance.

Extrahepatic metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) may cause a diagnostic 
problem. All 195 cases of histologic and immunostained sections were reviewed
retrospectively in one center. The expression of arginase-1 (Arg-1), hepatocyte
paraffin-1 (HepPar-1), glypican-3 (GPC-3), and α-Fetoprotein (AFP) was evaluated.
Eighty cases of metastatic tumors of the liver were also collected to verify
their effectiveness. Totally 151 cases had previous history of HCC, in whom 49
had history of liver transplantation. Forty-four cases were diagnosed as
metastatic HCC at initial presentation. The most common extrahepatic metastatic
sites were bone (57%), followed by lung, lymph node, etc. Around 19 cases were
positive for 1 marker, 22 were positive for 2 markers, 95 were positive for 3
markers, and 59 were positive for 4 markers. With the number of antibody
increased in the panel, the negative cases decreased. The sensitivity of ARG,
GPC-3, HepPar-1, and AFP was 82.6%, 89.2%, 83.6% and 53.8%, and the specificity
was 98.3%, 94.8%, 96.2% and 100%, respectively. These data suggest that the panel
of ARG-1, GPC-3, HepPar-1 and AFP has a high sensitivity and specificity to
differentiate HCC from non-HCC. This study indicated that HCC should be
considered when diagnosing metastasis of unclear origin. It is recommended to use
the panel of ARG-1, GPC-3, HepPar-1 and AFP to differentiate HCC from non-HCC in 
extrahepatic metastasis, because of their sensitivity and specificity, especially
in poorly differentiated lesions.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Drug resistance remains a main obstacle to the treatment of non-
small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of this study was to identify the
expression profiles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines.
METHODS: The expression profiles of miRNAs in drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines
were examined using miRNA sequencing, and the common dysregulated miRNAs in these
cell lines were identified and analyzed by bioinformatics methods.
RESULTS: A total of 29 upregulated miRNAs and 36 downregulated miRNAs were found 
in the drug-resistant NSCLC cell lines, of which 26 upregulated and 36
downregulated miRNAs were found to be involved in the Ras signaling pathway. The 
expression levels, survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curve
of the dysregulated miRNAs based on The Cancer Genome Atlas database for lung
adenocarcinoma showed that hsa-mir-192, hsa-mir-1293, hsa-mir-194, hsa-mir-561,
hsa-mir-205, hsa-mir-30a, and hsa-mir-30c were related to lung cancer, whereas
only hsa-mir-1293 and hsa-mir-561 were not involved in drug resistance.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study may provide novel biomarkers for drug
resistance in NSCLC and potential therapies for overcoming drug resistance, and
may also reveal the potential mechanisms underlying drug resistance in this
disease.

PURPOSE: Biomarkers that can predict response to anti-programmed cell death 1
(PD-1) therapy across multiple tumor types include a T-cell-inflamed
gene-expression profile (GEP), programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression, and 
tumor mutational burden (TMB). Associations between these biomarkers and the
clinical efficacy of pembrolizumab were evaluated in a clinical trial that
encompassed 20 cohorts of patients with advanced solid tumors.
METHODS: KEYNOTE-028 ( ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02054806) is a
nonrandomized, phase Ib trial that enrolled 475 patients with PD-L1-positive
advanced solid tumors who were treated with pembrolizumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks 
for 2 years or until confirmed disease progression or unacceptable toxicity
occurred. The primary end point was objective response rate (ORR; by RECIST v1.1,
investigator review). Secondary end points included safety, progression-free
survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Relationships between T-cell-inflamed 
GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB and antitumor activity were exploratory end
points.
RESULTS: ORRs (with 95% CIs) ranged from 0% (0.0% to 14.2%) in pancreatic cancer 
to 33% (15.6% to 55.3%) in small-cell lung cancer. Across cohorts, median (95%
CI) PFS ranged from 1.7 months (1.5 to 2.9 months) to 6.8 months (1.9 to 14.1
months) in pancreatic and thyroid cancers, respectively, and median OS from 3.9
months (2.8 to 5.5 months) to 21.1 months (9.1 to 22.4 months) in vulvar and
carcinoid tumors, respectively. Higher response rates and longer PFS were
demonstrated in tumors with higher T-cell-inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and/or 
TMB. Correlations of TMB with GEP and PD-L1 were low. Response patterns indicate 
that patients with tumors that had high levels of both TMB and inflammatory
markers (GEP or PD-L1) represent a population with the highest likelihood of
response. Safety was similar and consistent with prior pembrolizumab reports.
CONCLUSION: A T-cell--inflamed GEP, PD-L1 expression, and TMB predicted response 
to pembrolizumab in multiple tumor types. These biomarkers (alone/in combination)
may help identify patients who have a higher likelihood of response to anti-PD-1 
therapies across a broad spectrum of cancers.

Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs can be promising diagnostic and/or
prognostic markers for various cancers. In this study, we identified a novel
miRNA, miR-3607-3p, and its targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
expression of miR-3607-3p was measured and its correlation with patient prognosis
was determined. Ectopic expression in NSCLC cells, xenografts, and metastasis
models was used to evaluate the effects of miR-3607-3p on proliferation and
migration of NSCLC. Luciferase assay and western blotting were performed to
validate the potential targets of miR-3607-3p after preliminary screening by
microarray analysis and computer-aided algorithms. We demonstrated that
miR-3607-3p was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and that miR-3607-3p might act as 
an independent predictor for overall survival in NSCLC. Moreover, serum
miR-3607-3p may be a novel and stable marker for NSCLC. We found that
overexpression of miR-3607-3p inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation,
migration and invasion, and hampered the cell cycle of NSCLC cell lines in vitro.
Our results suggested that miR-3607-3p directly targets TGFBR1 and CCNE2. In
accordance with in vitro studies, we confirmed that miR-3607-3p functions as a
potent suppressor miRNA of NSCLC. We showed that miR-3607-3p agomir could reduce 
tumor growth and inhibit TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression. Taken together, our
findings indicate that miR-3607-3p can inhibit NSCLC cell growth and metastasis
by targeting TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression, and provide new evidence of
miR-3607-3p as a potential non-invasive biomarker and therapeutic target for
NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) accounts for approximately 40% of all lung
cancer patients. There is an urgent need to understand the mechanisms of cancer
progression in LUAD and to identify useful biomarkers to predict prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, Oncomine database was used to identify potential genes
contributed to cancer progression. Bioinformatics analysis including pathway
enrichment and text mining was used to explain the potential roles of identified 
genes in LUAD. The Cancer Genome Atlas database was used to analyze the
association of gene expression with survival result.
RESULTS: Our results indicated that 80 genes were significantly dysregulated in
LUAD according to four microarrays covering 356 cases of LUAD and 164 cases of
normal lung tissues. Twenty genes were consistently and stably dysregulated by
more than twofold. Ten of 20 genes had a relationship with overall survival or
disease-free survival in a cohort of 516 LUAD patients, and 19 genes were
associated with tumor stage, gender, age, lymph node, or smoking. Low expression 
of AGER and high expression of CCNB1 were specifically associated with poor
survival.
CONCLUSION: Our findings implicate AGER and CCNB1 might be potential biomarkers
for diagnosis and prognosis targets for LUAD.

Objectives: Lysyl oxidase like 2 (LOXL2) is associated with poor prognosis in
idiopathic pulmonary disease (IPF) and cancer. We developed an Enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (ELISA) targeting the LOXL2 neo-epitope generated through the
release of the signal peptide during LOXL2 maturation.
Design and methods: An ELISA targeting the N-terminal site of the human LOXL2 was
developed including technical optimization and validation steps. Serum LOXL2 was 
measured in patients with breast, colorectal, lung, ovarian, pancreatic and
prostate cancer, melanoma, IPF and in healthy controls (n = 16).
Results: A technically robust and specific assay was developed. LOXL2 was
detectable in serum from healthy controls and showed reactivity towards
recombinant LOXL2. Compared to controls, LOXL2 levels were significantly
(p < 0.001-0.05) elevated in serum from patients with breast, colerectal, lung,
ovarian and pancreatic cancer (mean range: 49-84 ng/mL), but not in prostate
cancer (mean: 36 ng/mL) and malignant melanoma patients (41 ng/mL). Serum LOXL2
was elevated in IPF patients compared to healthy controls (mean: 76.5 vs
46.8 ng/mL; p > 0.001).
Conclusions: A specific ELISA towards the N-terminal neo-epitope site in LOXL2
was developed which detected significantly elevated serum levels from patients
with above-mentioned cancer types or IPF compared to healthy controls.

Purpose: The identification of genomic alterations related to recurrence in
early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients may help better stratify 
high-risk individuals and guide treatment strategies. This study aimed to
identify the molecular biomarkers of recurrence in early-stage NSCLC.
Results: Of the 42 tumors evaluable for genomic alterations, TP53 and EGFR were
the most frequent alterations with population frequency 52.4% and 50.0%,
respectively. Fusion genes were detected in four patients, which had lower
mutational burden and relatively better genomic stability. EGFR mutation and
fusion gene were mutually exclusive in this study. CDKN2A, FAS, SUFU and SMARCA4 
genomic alterations were only observed in the relapsed patients. Increased copy
number alteration index was observed in early relapsed patients. Among these
genomic alterations, early-stage NSCLCs harboring CDKN2A, FAS, SUFU and SMARCA4
genomic alterations were found to be significantly associated with recurrence.
Some of these new findings were validated using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
dataset.
Conclusions: The genomic alterations of CDKN2A, FAS, SUFU and SMARCA4 in
early-stage NSCLC are found to be associated with recurrence, but confirmation in
a larger independent cohort is required to define the clinical impact.
Materials and Methods: Paired primary tumor and normal lung tissue samples were
collected for targeted next-generation sequencing analysis. A panel targets exons
for 440 genes was used to assess the mutational and copy number status of
selected genes in three clinically relevant groups of stage I/II NSCLC patients: 
1) Early relapse; 2) Late relapse; and 3) No relapse.

Introduction: Lung cancer ranks top in the cause of cancer death globally. The
identification of effective biomarkers is essential for non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) diagnosis. Methods: The expression levels of prolactin (PRL), CEA,
and CYFR21 in serum were assayed by ELISA. The blood samples were attained from
44 NSCLC cases and 44 healthy controls. Logistic regression and receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were applied to evaluate the diagnostic
efficacy and create diagnostic mathematical models. Results: Serum PRL, CEA, and 
CYFR21 levels were significantly higher in patients with NSCLC than the healthy
controls (all P-values <0.001). According to the model to predict NSCLC patients 
from the healthy controls, a combination of PRL, CEA, and CYFR21 biomarkers was
more effective than individual biomarker alone, with AUC = 0.960 (95% CI:
0.921-0.999), sensitivity = 0.909, specificity = 0.955, positive predicted value 
= 0.952, and negative predicted value = 0.913. Conclusion: Prolactin can be used 
as a potential serum biomarker for the diagnosis of NSCLC. A panel of PRL, CEA,
and CYFRA21 was found as promising serum biomarkers for the diagnosis of NSCLC
with relatively high sensitivity and specificity.

Cancer is one of the most important causes of mortality in the world, which can
be severely reduced by early detection to avoid future problems in the field of
economics and mental health. Hence, electrochemical nanobiosensors as portable
devices for rapid detection of ﻿ cancer biomarkers, have found an important place
in clinical medicine for diagnosis, managements or cancer screening. Although,
these biosensors have been receiving attention in the recent years, their
principles are unchanged. By progress in nanotechnology, a great potential has
been giving to nanobiosensors. Applications of a wide variety of nanomaterials in
developing electrochemical biosensors, led to the production of potential
nanobiosensors. Due to the high electrical conductivity, and increased surface
area relative to the volume along with more repeatability, the application of NPs
in electrochemical biosensors has been developed. Therefore, in this review, we
discussed the impact of nanomaterials on the accuracy of biosensors in early
cancer detection such as lung, prostate, breast, and other cancers. However, the 
modification of electrode performance by nanomaterials is relatively complicated,
which causes limitation for some nanomaterials to be used in﻿biosensor
applications. Indeed, the construction of electrodes based on nanomaterial
requires a simple, reliable and inexpensive route to increase the sensitivity and
reproducibility. Thus, the aim of this study can be defined as ﻿determining the
detection limit of electrochemical nanobiosensors as well as ﻿introducing﻿ the
challenges of fabricating and designing electrochemical nanobiosensors based on
nanomaterials and their evaluations in the future medical setting.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common type of lung tumor.
Deregulation of microRNA may be involved in the occurrence of NSCLC and we aimed 
to find the potential prognostic biomarkers for NSCLC. The microRNA microarray
expression profiles were downloaded from GEO dataset and then generated by
applying robust multi-array average (RMA). The normalized data was analyzed with 
a Bioconductor package linear model for microarray data and an independent
dataset was used to inspect the results. Then, the differentially expressed genes
were identified using the limma package. Besides, in order to investigate the
function of the differentially expressed microRNA in NSCLC, the GO and KEGG
functional enrichment analysis were applied, and the GSEA analysis was performed 
for mining the therapeutic candidates. A total of 160 differentially expressed
microRNAs were identified, among which 37 microRNAs showed significant expression
changes (up-regulated and down-regulated) with the same method in the validation 
dataset GSE74190. Multiple cancer-related pathways, such as AMPK signaling
pathway, AMPK signaling pathway, non-small cell lung cancer signaling pathway,
were determined by performing the functional enrichment analysis. Besides, the
results of GSEA analysis showed that the CCND1 was mostly enriched in lung cancer
group. In conclusion, a set of differentially expressed microRNAs in NSCLC was
identified and the CCND1 gene was determined as the potential prognostic
biomarkers for NSCLC, providing useful information for discovery of future
therapeutic targets and candidates in the clinical management of NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating studies have reported that GLUT1 is aberrantly expressed
in lung cancer; nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and the
prognostic role of GLUT1 still remain controversial. The aim of this
meta-analysis was to identify the clinicopathologic and prognostic implications
of the GLUT1 expression in lung cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases with literature published in English, including 
Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed, and the China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang database in Chinese were searched
comprehensively for relevant studies in August 2017. The pooled odds ratio (OR)
or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to
evaluate the clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of GLUT1 in lung
cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 26 studies (2653 cases) were included in the current study.
Totally, 1423 patients from nineteen studies were included to assess the
relationships between GLUT1 and clinicopathological parameters, the pooled OR
indicated that positive GLUT1 expression was significantly related with
classification (adenocarcinomas vs. squamous carcinomas, OR = 0.276, 95% CIs:
0.117-0.651, P = 0.003), tumor differentiation (G3-4 vs. G2~1, OR = 1.944, 95%
CIs: 1.384-2.730; P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (positive vs. negative,
OR = 3.65, 95% CIs: 1.82-7.32, P < 0.001),tumor size (large tumor size vs. small 
tumor size, OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.42-2.91, P < 0.001), and advanced tumor stages
(OR = 2.527, 95% CIs: 1.325-4.820). Regarding the significance of GLUT1 in the
overall survival (OS) of lung cancer, the pooled HRs with 1731 lung cancer
patients was 1.41 (P = 0.002; 95% CIs: 1.13-1.76). Additionally, the
overexpression of GLUT1 could significantly predict the shorter disease-free
survival (HR = 1.68, 95% CIs: 1.01-2.79) and disease-specific survival
(HR = 1.59, 95% CIs: 1.11-2.29).
CONCLUSIONS: A positive expression of GLUT1 significantly predicts a poor
prognosis in lung cancer patients. GLUT1 may server as a helpful biomarker and a 
potential target for the treatment strategies of lung cancer.

PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to define the dose and dose-volume
relationship of radiation-induced pulmonary toxicities occurring in and
out-of-field in mouse models of early inflammatory and late fibrotic response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Early radiation-induced inflammation and fibrosis were
investigated in C3H/NeJ and C57BL/6J mice, respectively. Animals were irradiated 
with 20 Gy delivered to the upper region of the right lung as a single fraction
or as 3 consecutive fractions using the Small Animal Radiation Research Platform 
(Xstrahl Inc, Camberley, UK). Cone beam computed tomography was performed for
image guidance before irradiation and to monitor late toxicity. Histologic
sections were examined for neutrophil and macrophage infiltration as markers of
early inflammatory response and type I collagen staining as a marker of
late-occurring fibrosis. Correlation was evaluated with the dose-volume histogram
parameters calculated for individual mice and changes in the observed cone beam
computed tomography values.
RESULTS: Mean lung dose and the volume receiving over 10 Gy (V10) showed
significant correlation with late responses for single and fractionated exposures
in directly targeted volumes. Responses observed outside the target volume were
attributed to nontargeted effects and showed no dependence on either mean lung
dose or V10.
CONCLUSIONS: Quantitative assessment of normal tissue response closely correlates
early and late pulmonary response with clinical parameters, demonstrating this
approach as a potential tool to facilitate clinical translation of preclinical
studies. Out-of-field effects were observed but did not correlate with dosimetric
parameters, suggesting that nontargeted effects may have a role in driving
toxicities outside the treatment field.

OBJECTIVES: To longitudinally investigate smoking cessation-related changes of
quantitative computed tomography (QCT)-based airway metrics in a group of heavy
smokers.
METHODS: CT scans were acquired in a lung cancer screening population over
4 years at 12-month intervals in 284 long-term ex-smokers (ES), 405 continuously 
active smokers (CS), and 31 subjects who quitted smoking within 2 years after
baseline CT (recent quitters, RQ). Total diameter (TD), lumen area (LA), and wall
percentage (WP) of 1st-8th generation airways were computed using airway analysis
software. Inter-group comparison was performed using Mann-Whitney U test or
Student's t test (two groups), and ANOVA or ANOVA on ranks with Dunn's multiple
comparison test (more than two groups), while Fisher's exact test or chi-squared 
test was used for categorical data. Multiple linear regression was used for
multivariable analysis.
RESULTS: At any time, TD and LA were significantly higher in ES than CS, for
example, in 5th-8th generation airways at baseline with 6.24 mm vs. 5.93 mm
(p < 0.001) and 15.23 mm2 vs. 13.51 mm2 (p < 0.001), respectively. RQ showed
higher TD (6.15 mm vs. 5.93 mm, n.s.) and significantly higher LA (14.77 mm2 vs. 
13.51 mm2, p < 0.001) than CS after 3 years, and after 4 years. In multivariate
analyses, smoking status independently predicted TD, LA, and WP at baseline, at
3 years and 4 years (p < 0.01-0.001), with stronger impact than pack years.
CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial dimensions depend on the smoking status. Smoking-induced
airway remodeling can be partially reversible after smoking cessation even in
long-term heavy smokers. Therefore, QCT-based airway metrics in clinical trials
should consider the current smoking status besides pack years.
KEY POINTS: • Airway lumen and diameter are decreased in active smokers compared 
to ex-smokers, and there is a trend towards increased airway wall thickness in
active smokers. • Smoking-related airway changes improve within 2 years after
smoking cessation. • Smoking status is an independent predictor of airway
dimensions.

Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) targeting epidermal growth factor receptors
(EGFR) significantly prolong the survival of lung adenocarcinoma patients with
sensitizing EGFR mutations. Unfortunately, 10-30% patients do not show objective 
responses to EGFR-TKIs, and undergo rapid disease progression during the
EGFR-TKIs therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mature microRNA
(miRNA) sequences may influence target site interactions and modulate downstream 
pathways, such as the EGFR pathway. For this reason, we hypothesized that miRNA
SNPs may impact the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients after EGFR-TKI
treatment. By systematically screening of the miRbase and the 1000 genomes
project databases, we successfully identified five mature miRNA SNPs. Genotypes
were determined in two independent cohorts (Hubei and Shandong cohorts) that
include 319 EGFR-TKI treated stage IIIB/IV patients. The impact of miR-608 and
miR-4513 on the drug sensitivity of gefitinib was examined in lung adenocarcinoma
cells. miR-608 rs4919510 or miR-4513 rs2168518 significantly contributed to the
progression-free survival (PFS) in the Hubei cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63,
confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.81, P = 3.0 × 10-4 or HR = 0.46, 95%
CI = 0.31-0.67, P = 8.0 × 10-5). These observations were further validated in the
Shandong cohort (P = 0.005 or P = 0.001). Similarly, the miR-608 rs4919510 CC
genotype or the miR-4513 rs2168518 GA genotype was significantly associated with 
decreased death risk after gefitinib treatment, compared with the rs4919510 GG
genotype (Hubei cohort: P = 5.0 × 10-4; Shandong cohort: P = 0.004) or the
rs2168518 GG genotype (P = 4.9 × 10-5; P = 0.002). Consistently, miR-608
significantly increased the anti-proliferation effect of gefitinib in both lung
adenocarcinoma PC9 and H1299 cells, whereas miR-4513 increased cells' resistance 
to gefitinib. Our findings suggest that miR-608 and miR-4513 SNPs are independent
candidate biomarkers to predict lung adenocarcinoma patients' survival after
EGFR-TKIs treatment. These miRNAs and polymorphisms provide clinical potential in
patient-tailored treatment decision-making.

Lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cardiovascular disease
are highly prevalent in the general population and expected to cause most deaths 
by 2050. For these "Big-3," treatment might cure, delay, or stop the progression 
of disease at a very early stage. Lung nodule growth rate (a biomarker for lung
cancer), emphysema/air trapping (a biomarker for chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease), and coronary artery calcification (a biomarker for cardiovascular
disease) are imaging biomarkers of early stages of the Big-3 that can be acquired
with low-dose computed tomography (CT). We hypothesize that a (combined) low-dose
CT examination for detection of all 3 diseases may significantly improve the
cost-effectiveness of screening in the future. We review the current evidence of 
the imaging biomarkers for the detection of the Big-3 diseases and present the
potential health economic potential of Big-3 screening. Furthermore, we review
the low-dose CT protocols to acquire these biomarkers and describe the technical 
considerations when combining the CT protocols for the different biomarkers.

Novel therapies to treat patients with solid cancers that have developed
resistance to chemotherapy represent unmet needs of considerable dimensions. In
the present review, we will address the attempts to develop chimeric antigen
receptor (CAR) targeted immunotherapy against osteosarcoma (OS). This aggressive 
cancer displays its peak incidence in children and young adults. The main cause
of patient death is lung metastases with a 5-year survival as low as 5%-10% in
the primary metastatic setting and 30% in the relapse situation, respectively.
Effective adjuvant combination chemotherapy introduced more than 40 years ago
improved the survival rates from below 20% to around 60% in patients; however,
since then, no major breakthroughs have been made. The use of immune checkpoint
inhibitors has been disappointing in OS, while other types of immunotherapies
such as CAR T cells remain largely unexplored. Indeed, for CAR T-cell therapy to 
be efficacious, two main criteria need to be fulfilled: (a) CAR T cells should
target an epitope selectively expressed on the cell surface of OS in order to
prevent toxicities in normal tissues and (b) the target should also be widely
expressed on OS metastases. These challenges have already been undertaken in OS
and illustrate the difficulties in developing tomorrow's CAR-T treatment in a
solid tumour. We will discuss the experiences with CAR-T therapy development and 
efficacy to combat the clinical challenges in OS.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality worldwide, with
adenocarcinomas of the non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) subtype accounting
for the majority of cases. Therefore, an urgent need exists for a more detailed
dissection of the molecular events driving NSCLC development and the
identification of clinically relevant biomarkers. Even though originally
identified as a tumour suppressor, recent studies associate the cytoplasmically
(mis)localised CDK inhibitor p27Kip1 (p27) with unfavourable responses to
chemotherapy and poor outcomes in NSCLC, supporting the hypothesis that the
protein can execute oncogenic activities. In a recent issue of The Journal of
Pathology, Calvayrac and coworkers uncover a novel molecular mechanism that can
explain this oncogenic role of p27. They demonstrate that cytoplasmic p27 binds
and inhibits the small GTPase RhoB and thereby relieves a selection pressure for 
RhoB loss that is frequently observed in NSCLC. This is supported not only by
studies with genetically modified mice, but also through identification of a
cohort of human lung cancer patients with cytoplasmic p27 and continued RhoB
expression, where this signature correlates with decreased survival. This not
only establishes a potentially useful biomarker, but also provides yet another
facet of the complex roles p27 undertakes in tumourigenesis. © 2018 The Authors.

Despite substantial progress in oncology, lung cancer remains the number one
malignancy in terms of both incidence and mortality rates, and there thus remains
an urgent need for new therapeutic alternatives. MicroRNA (miRNA) have an
important role in cancer initiation and progression due to their capacity to
interfere with transcriptional signaling and regulate key cellular processes.
miR-181a and miR-181b (miR-181a/b), which are located on chromosomes 1 and 9, are
pathologically expressed in the tumor tissue and plasma of patients diagnosed
with lung cancer. The miR-181a/b regulatory mechanisms are sophisticated and are 
directly related to different target genes. In recent years, an ever-increasing
number of studies have focused on the biological relevance of miR-181a/b in key
cellular processes. In this paper, we aim to discuss the challenging experimental
data related to miR-181a/b and their potential use for the development of new
therapeutic approaches in lung cancer. We will further present the ongoing issues
regarding the regulation of their multiple target genes, and their potential use 
as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in this deadly malignancy.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether radiomic features can be surrogate biomarkers
for epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation statuses.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two hundred ninety six consecutive patients, who underwent
CT examinations before operation within 3 months and had EGFR mutations tested,
were enrolled in this retrospective study. CT texture features were extracted
using an open-source software with whole volume segmentation. The association
between CT texture features and EGFR mutation statuses were analyzed.
RESULTS: In the 296 patients, there were 151 patients with EGFR mutations (51%). 
Logistic analysis identified that lower age (Odds Ratio[OR]: 0.968,95% confidence
interval [CI]:0.946~0.990, p = 0.005) and a radiomic feature named
GreyLevelNonuniformityNormalized (OR: 0.012, 95% CI:0.000~0.352, p = 0.01) were
predictors for exon 19 mutation; higher age (OR: 1.027,
95%CI:1.003~1.052,p = 0.025), female sex (OR: 2.189, 95%CI:1.264~3.791,
p = 0.005) and a radiomic feature named Maximum2DDiameterColumn (OR: 0.968,
95%CI:0.946~0.990], p = 0.005) for exon 21 mutation; and female sex (OR:
1.883,95%CI:1.064~3.329, p = 0.030), non-smoking status (OR: 2.070,
95%CI:1.090~3.929, p = 0.026) and a radiomic feature termed SizeZone
NonUniformityNormalized (OR: 0.010, 95% CI:0.0001~0.852, p = 0.042) for EGFR
mutations. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of combination with clinical and radiomic
features to predict exon 19 mutation, exon 21 mutation and EGFR mutations were
0.655, 0.675 and 0.664, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Several radiomic features are associated with EGFR mutation statuses 
of lung adenocarcinoma. Combination with clinical files, moderate diagnostic
performance can be obtained to predict EGFR mutation status of lung
adenocarcinoma. Radiomic features might harbor potential surrogate biomarkers for
identification of EGRF mutation statuses.

Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) plays a role in protecting the
pancreas against premature activation of trypsinogen and is involved in cancer
progression. SPINK1 promoted LAC cells growth, migration, and invasion.
Mechanistically, we found that SPINK1 promoted LAC cells migration and invasion
via up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12). We observed that SPINK1
expression was only up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) tissues, and was an
independent prognostic factor for poor survival. Our results indicate that SPINK1
might be a potential biomarker for LAC that promotes progression by MMP12. [BMB
Reports 2018; 51(12): 648-653].

Calretinin (CR; CALB2) belonging to the family of EF-hand Ca2+-binding proteins
(CaBP) is widely used as a positive marker for the identification of human
malignant mesothelioma (MM) and functionally was suggested to play a critical
role during carcinogenesis of this highly aggressive asbestos-associated
neoplasm. Increasing evidence suggests that CR not only acts as a prototypical
Ca2+ buffer protein, i.e., limiting the amplitude of Ca2+ signals but also as a
Ca2+ sensor. No studies have yet investigated whether other closely related CaBPs
might serve as substitutes for CR's functions(s) in MM cells. Genetically
modified MM cell lines with medium (MSTO-211H and ZL5) or low (SPC111) endogenous
CR expression levels were generated that overexpress either CR's closest
homologue calbindin-D28k (CB) or parvalbumin (PV), the latter considered as a
"pure" Ca2+ buffer protein. After lentiviral shCALB2-mediated CR downregulation, 
in both MSTO-211H and ZL5 cells expressing CB or PV, the CR deficiency-mediated
increase in cell death was not prevented by CB or PV. With respect to
proliferation and cell morphology of SPC111 cells, CB was able to substitute for 
CR, but not for CR's other functions to promote cell migration or invasion. In
conclusion, CR has a likely unique role in MM that cannot be substituted by
"similar" CaBPs.

Reversal of resistance to chemotherapy following anti-programmed cell death-1
immunotherapy in metastatic lung adenocarcinoma: A case report.

Liu X(1), Liu H, Luo S.

Author information: 
(1)Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University & Henan Cancer Hospital,
Zhengzhou, Henan, China.

RATIONALE: For metastatic non-small cell lung cancer with no epidermal growth
factor receptor mutations or anaplastic lymphoma kinase gene rearrangements,
programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) blockade is preferentially recommended post
first-line chemotherapy. However, still many patients do not respond to these
agents. After development of resistance to PD-1 blockade, further evaluation of
chemotherapy regimen will be necessary.
PATIENT CONCERNS: A 57-year old man had cough with minimal whitish expectoration.
Computed tomography (CT) scans showed that he had an upper lobe mass of his left 
lung and multiple lymphadenectasis, including mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes, 
and also to the right intrapulmonary lymph nodes.
DIAGNOSES: The patient was diagnosed with adenocarcinoma after a biopsy was
conducted on the upper lobe mass of his left lung.
INTERVENTIONS: The patient received pemetrexed plus cisplatin (Pem-Cis) treatment
for 6 cycles and sequential thoracic radiation as a therapeutic schedule. CT
demonstrated a confirmed partial response after these treatments. Three months
later, the tumors continued to grow. The patient received successive
pemetrexed-based chemotherapy regimens; however, these regimens failed to stop
tumor progression. The patient subsequently underwent 6 cycles of PD-1 mAb
pembrolizumab treatment.
OUTCOMES: Sensitivity of chemotherapy was restored, and the patient displayed a
reduction in the size of enlarged mediastinal and hilar lymph nodes after 2
cycles of treatment with Pem-Cis, the initially used chemotherapy regimen.
LESSONS: This outcome suggests that PD-1 blockade holds promise as a treatment
strategy for reversion of chemotherapy resistance in refractory lung
adenocarcinoma and warrants additional studies.

The introduction of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the
treatment and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, these patients
display disease progression driven by the onset of acquired mechanisms of drug
resistance that limit the efficacy of EGFR-TKI to no longer than one year.
Moreover, a small fraction of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients does not benefit from
this targeted treatment due to primary (i.e. intrinsic) mechanisms of resistance 
that preexist prior to TKI drug treatment. Research efforts are focusing on
deciphering the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance, which
should prompt the development of novel antitumor agents that surmount such
chemoresistance modalities. The capability of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate the 
expression of many oncogenic pathways and their central role in lung cancer
progression, provided new directions for research on prognostic biomarkers, as
well as innovative tools for predicting patients' response to systemic therapies.
Recent evidence suggests that modulation of key miRNAs may also reverse oncogenic
signaling pathways, and potentiate the cytotoxic effect of anti-cancer therapies.
In this review, we focus on the putative emerging role of miRNAs in modulating
drug resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Moreover, we discuss
the current implications of miRNAs analyses in the clinical setting, using both
tissue and liquid biopsies, as well as the future potential use of miRNA-based
therapies in overcoming resistance to targeted agents like TKIs.

PURPOSE: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a
variety of cancers. Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and
prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers.
METHODS: Over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database were analyzed to determine the
distribution of germline and somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. Subsequently,
7,893 cancer cases were compiled in cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33
most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of
TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival
times.
RESULTS: The data were analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53
mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 
248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of
codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33
TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in
nine cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and
thymoma) for survival time and in five cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma)
for disease-free survival time. It was also found that the most common p53
mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for
poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole. In addition, in cases of ovarian
serous cystadenocarcinoma, the co-occurrence of TP53 and BRCA mutations resulted 
in longer survival and disease-free survival times than the presence of neither
TP53 nor BRCA mutations.
CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to
further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival
times of cancer patients.

Pectolinarigenin inhibits non‑small cell lung cancer progression by regulating
the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer‑-associated mortality.
Pectolinarigenin (Pec) reportedly has effective antitumor activity against
certain cancer types. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well‑known tumor
suppressor and serves a vital role in cancer progression. However, the effect of 
Pec on non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation and metastasis, and 
the underlying mechanism, has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, it
was demonstrated that Pec inhibited the proliferation of A549 and Calu‑3 cells in
dose‑ and time‑dependent manners. The apoptosis rate significantly increased with
increasing doses of Pec. Apoptosis‑associated protein expression was additionally
altered by Pec exposure. Pec was able to suppress the metastasis of NSCLC cells; 
it upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of E‑cadherin, and
downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of vimentin. Additionally,
Pec was able to activate PTEN and subsequently downregulate the PI3K/protein
kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. In summary, Pec was able to inhibit cell
proliferation, promote apoptosis and suppress metastasis in NSCLC cells through
the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating that Pec is a potential agent for
NSCLC therapy.

Hypochlorous acid (HClO) is a promising diagnostic marker for inflammation and
relevant diseases. Although many probes were previously developed for HClO
imaging, the development of organ targeting probes is still lacking. Herein, we
designed and synthesized a series of cyanine derivatives as ratiometric
fluorescent probes to detect endogenous HClO in the lungs with inflammation. By
installing diverse lipid chains and amino groups on cyanine, we identified that
ClO1, with one n-octadecane chain and two
2-[[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]methylamino]-ethyl groups, is a superior probe to
target the lungs over other major organs in mice. ClO1 was able to sense both
exogenous and endogenous HClO in A549 (human lung epithelial) cells through
fluorescence ratiometric imaging. In a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced lung
inflammation mouse model, ClO1 effectively captured endogenous HClO in the lungs 
after intravenous administration. Overall, these cyanine-derived probes merit
further development as organ targeting HClO sensors.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-associated mortality worldwide.
Smoking is one of the most significant etiological contributors to lung cancer
development. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying smoking-induced
induction and progression of lung cancer have remained to be fully elucidated.
Furthermore, long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are increasingly recognized to have
important roles in diverse biological processes. The present study focused on
identifying differentially expressed mRNAs, lncRNAs and micro (mi)RNAs in
smoking-associated lung cancer. Smoking-associated co-expression networks and
protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were constructed to identify hub
lncRNAs and genes in smoking-associated lung cancer. Furthermore, Gene Ontology
and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes analyses of differentially expressed 
lncRNAs were performed. A total of 314 mRNAs, 24 lncRNAs and 4 miRNAs were
identified to be deregulated in smoking-associated lung cancer. PPI network
analysis identified 20 hub genes in smoking-associated lung cancer, including
dynein axonemal heavy chain 7, dynein cytoplasmic 2 heavy chain 1, WD repeat
domain 78, collagen type III α 1 chain (COL3A1), COL1A1 and COL1A2. Furthermore, 
co-expression network analysis indicated that relaxin family peptide receptor 1, 
receptor activity modifying protein 2-antisense RNA 1, long intergenic
non-protein coding RNA 312 (LINC00312) and LINC00472 were key lncRNAs in
smoking-associated lung cancer. A bioinformatics analysis indicated these
smoking-associated lncRNAs have a role in various processes and pathways,
including cell proliferation and the cyclic guanosine monophosphate cGMP)/protein
kinase cGMP-dependent 1 signaling pathway. Of note, these hub genes and lncRNAs
were identified to be associated with the prognosis of lung cancer patients. In
conclusion, the present study provides useful information for further exploring
the diagnostic and prognostic value of the potential candidate biomarkers, as
well as their utility as drug targets for smoking-associated lung cancer.

Targeting lung cancer initiating cells by all-trans retinoic acid-loaded
lipid-PLGA nanoparticles with CD133 aptamers.

Lung cancer initiating cells represent a specific subpopulation of lung cancer
cells, which significantly contribute to the initiation, metastasis and
recurrence of lung cancer. CD133, initially considered a marker of stem cells, is
now considered as a marker for lung cancer initiating cells. All-trans retinoic
acid (RA) has been demonstrated to cause the differentiation, inhibition of
proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells and cancer initiating cells.
However, there have been no reports on the activity of RA against lung cancer
initiating cells. In the present study, the activity of RA against lung cancer
initiating cells was investigated by determining the cytotoxicity, and performing
a tumorsphere assay and flow cytometry-based analysis. In addition, to promote
the therapeutic effect of RA in CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells, RA-loaded
lipid poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with CD133 aptamers
(RA-LPNPs-CD133) were developed. The activity of RA and RA-LPNPs-CD133 against
lung cancer initiating cells was also investigated. RA-LPNPs-CD133 had a size of 
129.9 nm, and exhibited sustained release of RA during the 144-h period. For the 
first time, to the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated that RA 
exerted potent activity towards CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells. The results 
also showed that RA-LPNPs-CD133 efficiently and specifically promoted the
delivery of RA to CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells, exhibiting superior
inhibitory effects against CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells compared with
non-targeted nanoparticles and RA. To the best of our knowledge, the present
study is the first to report the promotion of RA delivery via nanoparticles to
lung cancer initiating cells and achievement of a superior inhibitory effect
against lung cancer initiating cells by the utilization of CD133 aptamers.
Therefore, RA-LPNPs-CD133 represents a promising tool for the elimination of lung
cancer initiating cells.

Esfandi F, Kholghi Oskooei V, Taheri F, Kiani A, Taheri M, Ghafouri-Fard S.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer as the most fatal cancer of men has prompted researchers 
to find biomarkers for early detection and prognosis. Among the possible
biomarkers are a group of non-coding transcripts with sizes more than 200
nucleotides called long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs).
AIMS: In the present study, we evaluated the expression levels of the lncRNA OIP5
antisense RNA 1 (OIP5-AS1) in 32 non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) samples
compared with their corresponding adjacent non-cancerous tissue (ANCTs) by means 
of real-time polymerase chain reaction. The samples were obtained from patients
who were admitted at Labbafi-Nejad Hospital during 2015 and 2016.
RESULTS: OIP5-AS expression levels was significantly decreased in tumoral tissues
compared with ANCTs in total samples and in male subgroup. However, no
association was found between relative expression of OIP5-AS1 and
clinicopathological data of patients or history of smoking. Expression levels of 
this lncRNA were not correlated with patients age.
CONCLUSIONS: This lncRNA is possibly a novel biomarker of NSCLC in Iranian
patients. Future studies are needed to confirm the results of our study in larger
sample sizes. Moreover, based on the difference in lung cancer associated risk
factors in different populations, population-based studies are needed to explore 
the role of this lncRNA in the pathogenesis of cancers in each region to design
appropriate targeted therapies for each population. Key words: lung cancer -
OIP5-AS - lncRNA - long non-coding RNA.

Background: Association between oral bacteria and increased risk of lung cancer
have been reported in several previous studies, however, the potential
association between salivary microbiome and lung cancer in non-smoking women have
not been evaluated. There is also no report on the relationship between
immunocytochemistry markers and salivary microbiota. Method: In this study, we
assessed the salivary microbiome of 75 non-smoking female lung cancer patients
and 172 matched healthy individuals using 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. We
also calculated the Spearman's rank correlation coefficient between salivary
microbiota and three immunohistochemical markers (TTF-1, Napsin A and CK7).
Result: We analyzed the salivary microbiota of 247 subjects and found that
non-smoking female lung cancer patients exhibited oral microbial dysbiosis. There
was significantly lower microbial diversity and richness in lung cancer patients 
when compared to the control group (Shannon index, P < 0.01; Ace index, P <
0.0001). Based on the analysis of similarities, the composition of the microbiota
in lung cancer patients also differed from that of the control group (r = 0.454, 
P < 0.001, unweighted UniFrac; r = 0.113, P < 0.01, weighted UniFrac). The
bacterial genera Sphingomonas (P < 0.05) and Blastomonas (P < 0.0001) were
relatively higher in non-smoking female lung cancer patients, whereas
Acinetobacter (P < 0.001) and Streptococcus (P < 0.01) were higher in controls.
Based on Spearman's correlation analysis, a significantly positive correlation
can be observed between CK7 and Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.223, P < 0.05). At the 
same time, Napsin A was positively associated with genera Blastomonas (r = 0.251,
P < 0.05). TTF-1 exhibited a significantly positive correlation with
Enterobacteriaceae (r = 0.262, P < 0.05). Functional analysis from inferred
metagenomes indicated that oral microbiome in non-smoking female lung cancer
patients were related to cancer pathways, p53 signaling pathway, apoptosis and
tuberculosis. Conclusions: The study identified distinct salivary microbiome
profiles in non-smoking female lung cancer patients, revealed potential
correlations between salivary microbiome and immunocytochemistry markers used in 
clinical diagnostics, and provided proof that salivary microbiota can be an
informative source for discovering non-invasive lung cancer biomarkers.

Cigarette smoke contains more than 4,500 chemicals; most of which are highly
reactive free radicals, which induce proinflammatory and carcinogenic reactions. 
Numerous efforts have focused extensively on the role of cigarette smoking as a
cause of many diseases. Extracellular vesicles and exosomes have recently
received increasing interest for their diagnostic and therapeutic roles in many
diseases. However, research done on the role of extracellular vesicles and
exosomes on cigarette smoke-induced chronic disease is still in its infancy. In
this review, we summarize the recently addressed roles of extracellular vesicles 
and exosomes in the pathogenesis of cigarette smoke-related diseases, such as
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, lung cancer, and
oral cancer. Moreover, their potential utilization and future prospects as
diagnostic biomarkers for cigarette smoke-related diseases are described.

Miyazaki, Kihara 5200, Kiyotake, Miyazaki, 889-1692, Japan.

Background: It has been well accepted that the prognosis of non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients with interstitial pneumonia (IP) is significantly poor.
However, there are only a few studies that indicated the prognostic factors,
especially tumor markers, among NSCLC patients with IP.
Methods: Forty-one NSCLC patients with IP who underwent surgery at our
institution were included. Patients died of other diseases including
postoperative acute exacerbation (AE) of IP were excluded. Univariate and
multivariate analyses were calculated by the Cox proportional hazards regression 
model.
Results: The 5-year cancer-specific survival of overall and stage I patients were
37.4% and 39.2%, respectively. The 5-year cancer-specific survival of patients
with high serum carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) level was 9.4%, while that with
normal serum CEA level was 55.6%. However, serum cytokeratin-19 fragment (CYFRA
21-1) and squamous cell carcinoma-related antigen (SCC) levels were not
associated with patients' survival. Furthermore, serum CEA level was
significantly associated with poorer cancer-specific survival in univariate and
multivariate analyses.
Conclusions: This study demonstrated that serum CEA level might serve as an
efficient prognostic indicator after surgery in NSCLC with IP.

Correlation of Serum Levels of Urokinase Activation Plasminogen (uPA) and Its
Inhibitor (PAI-1) with Hormonal and HER-2 Status in the Early Invasive Breast
Cancer.

Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina.

Introduction: Breast cancer is the most common malignant tumor in women. On the
list of causes of death immediately after lung cancer. It is a heterogeneous
disease, considering the differences in morphological, cytogenetic, molecular,
clinical and therapeutic aspects, so that the prognosis in a patient with the
same histological grade and pathological status may vary.
Aim: In this paper we wanted to identify the correlation between the assay of the
serum values of uPA-PAI-1 complexes and individual prognostic-predictive
parameters, primarily with the status of estrogenic (Er), progesterogenic (PgR)
and Her-2 receptors ("human epidermal growth factor).
Material and methods: The study was conducted at the Clinic for General and
Abdominal Surgery, University Clinical Center of Sarajevo (CCUS), from September 
2016 to April 2017. The study included 66 patients, ages 18 to 75, in whom by the
needle biopsy preoperatively was pathohistologically verified primary invasive
breast cancer.
Results: Two thirds of the sample were classified as invasive ductal carcinoma,
similar to the percentage (68.2%) of pT2 size, and almost half in the grade G3.
Lymph node status was negative in 54.5% of respondents, and positive in 31.8% of 
respondents. Most patients had positive estrogenic (83.3%) and progesterone
receptors (62.1%). Almost 80% was Her-2 negative. The blood vessel invasion was
present in 56.1%, while the neural invasion was present in less than a third of
the sample (30.3%). Median values of uPA-PAI-1 complexes were 1.4 (interquartile 
range 0.9); almost 70% of the sample was negative for the status analysis of
uPA-PAI-1 complex (<1).
Discussion: A statistically significant difference was determined in the mean
values of uPA-PAI-1 complexes in subgroups according to menopausal status, tumor 
size, histological grade, histological type (invasive ductal carcinoma vs.
invasive lobular cancer versus invasive ductal carcinoma vs. invasive lobular
cancer), status axillary lymph nodes, Ki67 status (as binary variables), invasion
of the blood vessels and neural invasion, as well as subgroups according to the
status of expression of hormonal (estrogen and progesterone) receptors.
Conclusion: There is a statistically significant difference in the mean values of
the uPA-PAI-1 complex and Her-2 receptor expression. Generally, in perspective,
this would be the role played by the uPA/PAI-1 complex in breast cancer, which is
that the elevated complex values have a negative prognosis and effect on
survival, similar to the negative Her-2 receptor status. Complex uPA/PAI-1 is not
a specific serum protein in breast cancer patients and cannot be taken as an
individual prognostic-predictive marker for mass pre- or post treatment screening
and prediction. Unfortunately, none of the biomarkers are able to independently
and fully identify patients of the unknown stage of the disease with better or
worse prognosis or to identify cases of more aggressive tumor behavior of the
same stage for timely inclusion of adjuvant therapy and reduction of the risk of 
metastatic disease. The decision on treatment and prognosis should be the result 
of a combination of all diagnostic, therapeutic, pathohistological and
molecular-genetic variables.

Insulinoma-associated protein 1 (INSM1) and orthopedia homeobox (OTP) are
transcription factors that play a critical role in neuroendocrine (NE) and
neuroepithelial cell development. INSM1 has been identified in multiple tumors of
NE or neuroepithelial origin, whereas OTP expression has been mainly studied in
NE tumors of pulmonary origin. Expression of OTP appears to correlate with poorer
prognosis in pulmonary carcinoids; however, its expression patterns in other
NE/neuroepithelial tumors need further investigation. Here, we assessed the
diagnostic utility of INSM1 and OTP in tumors with NE differentiation at
relatively uncommon sites including prostate, breast, and tumors of gynecologic
origin. Thirty-two formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded cases were used to construct
a tissue microarray. Immunohistochemistry for INSM1 and OTP was performed and
scored semi-quantitatively. INSM1 was diffusely expressed in 60% of gynecologic
tumors, 71.4% of mammary carcinoma, and 25% of prostate adenocarcinoma with NE
differentiation. Diffuse expression of OTP was detected in 50% of prostate
adenocarcinoma with NE differentiation and 100% neuroendocrine carcinoma of the
ovary. Immunostain for achaete-scute homolog 1, chromogranin, synaptophysin, and 
CD56 supported the NE and/or neuroepithelial differentiation of the tumors. In
summary, INSM1 is expressed in most of the tumors with NE and neuroepithelial
differentiation in this study, confirming the diagnostic utility of INSM1 as a
novel and sensitive marker of NE/neuroepithelial differentiation. The expression 
of OTP in some NE tumors outside of lung expands the spectrum of tumors that may 
express this biomarker and should be considered when working up a NE tumor of
unknown primary site.

BACKGROUND: Hsp90-beta has been investigated to be correlated with the occurrence
and development of tumor. The intention of this research was to test the level of
Hsp90-beta in malignant pleural effusion (MPE) of patients with lung cancer and
disclose the clinical significance of Hsp90-beta as a potential tumor marker for 
differential diagnosis of pleural effusion caused by lung cancer.
METHODS: The level of Hsp90-beta was determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay. Calculations of the Hsp90-beta threshold, the sensitivity and specificity 
for distinguishing MPE from benign pleural effusion were performed using receiver
operator characteristic curve.
RESULTS: The level of Hsp90-beta in MPE of lung cancer patients was higher than
that in control individuals (P < 0.05) and increased MPE Hsp90-beta was
correlated with the pathological differentiation, tumor size and lymphatic
metastasis (P < 0.05). The cutoff value of Hsp90-beta produced by receiver
operator characteristic curve for distinguishing lung cancer from control
individuals were 1.659 ng/mL and the sensitivity and specificity were 93.46 and
79%.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased Hsp90-beta in MPE was correlated with malignant biological
behavior of lung cancer patients, indicating that the level of Hsp90-beta could
be a tool of referential value for differential diagnosis of pleural effusion
caused by lung cancer.

Aims: In this study, we investigated the expression of thyroid transcription
factor-1 (TTF-1) in lung adenocarcinoma patients' samples and analyzed the
association of TTF-1 with clinicopathological parameters, prognosis, and
treatment options in patients with lung adenocarcinoma.
Subjects and Methods: This retrospective study enrolled 200 patients who were
histologically confirmed lung adenocarcinoma with Stage I-IV disease, between
2008 and 2015 years. The cytological archive of these hospitals' Pathology
Department was searched. The available slides and the clinical information were
reviewed and correlated. All analyses were conducted by SPSS version 15.0
statistical software.
Results: Sixty-five (32.5%) of the patients showed TTF-1 negativity and 135
(67.5%) of them showed TTF-1 positivity. The median survival for TTF-1 positive
and negative patients was 19.6 and 12.2 months, respectively. We did not find any
statistical significance in-between the parameters in terms of the survival data.
In TTF-1-negative group, the survival time of epidermal growth factor receptor
mutation positive (P = 0.049), cytokeratin 7 (CK7) positive (P = 0.009) patients 
and those who had received curative radiotherapy (P = 0.028) was significantly
better as compared to TTF-1-positive group. We also analyzed the relation between
TTF-1 and survival outcome or chemotherapy selection in Stage IV disease. We
could not identify any correlation between TTF-1 and survival outcome or
treatment selection.
Conclusions: This study suggests that TTF-1 is not a favorable prognostic factor 
in lung adenocarcinoma patients. The prognostic role of CK7 and relationship
between TFF-1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma and predictive role of TTF-1
expression for the selection of first-line treatment in Stage IV lung
adenocarcinoma should be validated in prospective and randomized studies.

Aims: The association between forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and survival of nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been extensively investigated. However, the results 
were conflicted and inconclusive. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to
precisely estimate the association between FOXM1 and survival of NSCLC.
Materials and Methods: Studies were searched using the PubMed and EMBASE. The
strength of the association was calculated with the hazard ratios (HRs) and
respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: Result of this meta-analysis showed that high expression of FOXM1 was
significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) of NSCLC (HR = 1.82; 
95% CI 1.45-2.29). In the stratified analysis by country, we found that the
expression of FOXM1 was significantly associated with shorter OS in Chinese NSCLC
patients (HR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.45-2.29). In addition, high expression of FOXM1
decreased the OS in patients with surgery (HR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.37-2.58).
Furthermore, the results were still positive in both large sample size studies
and small sample size studies.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that overexpression of FOXM1 might be
associated with shorter OS of NSCLC patients.

Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor relapse after
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of
this study is to explore the profile and role of microRNA (miRNA) in CSC of
NSCLC.
Materials and Methods: We studied the expression of stem cell marker in side
population cells and serum-free cultured spheres of NSCLC. We identified that
CD133+ CD34- cells are NSCLC stem cell. We isolated CD133+ CD34- cells and CD133-
CD34+ cells with MicroBead Kit. We verified that H1650 CD133+ CD34- cells have
CSC characteristics with doxorubicin, radiation, and xenograft. We studied miRNA 
expression profile in H1650 and HCC827 CD133+ CD34- cells with microarray
analysis. We detected proliferation, migration, and invasion with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, scratch test,
and Transwell chamber invasion assay, respectively.
Results: CD133 and CD34 are CSC markers in H1650. We demonstrated that H1650
CD133+ CD34- cells have CSC characteristics and found that miR-27a was highly
expressed in H1650 CD133+ CD34- cells. In addition, we showed that miR-27a
regulates proliferation, migration, and invasion in H1650 cell line and
demonstrated that miR-27a expression was positively related to epidermal growth
factor receptor in NSCLC cell lines.
Conclusions: CD133+ CD34- is a CSC marker in H1650. miR-27a is highly expressed
in H1650 CSCs and regulates cancer development in H1650. miR-27a may be a
potential target for NSCLC therapy.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Respiratory, The First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou
University, Zhengzhou 450052, China.

Aim of the Study: Garcinia hanburyi is a traditional herbal medicine with
activities of anti-inflammation and hemostasis used by people in South Asia.
Gambogic acid (GA) is the main active component extracted from it, which has
anticancer and anti-inflammatory effects. The aim of the current study is to
investigate the molecular mechanisms of GA's effective anticancer activity.
Materials and Methods: 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium
bromide assay was used to measure cell proliferation. Apoptosis induced by GA was
analyzed by flow cytometry. In addition, monodansylcadaverine (MDC) and
2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate were used to evaluate autophagy and reactive 
oxygen species (ROS) generation, respectively.
Results: GA could significantly inhibit nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
NCI-H441 cell growth. In addition, GA induced NCI-H441 cells autophagy, confirmed
by MDC staining, upregulation of Beclin 1 (initiation factor for autophagosome
formation), and conversion of LC3 I to LC3 II (autophagosome marker). Moreover,
generated ROS was induced by GA in NCI-H441 cells and the ROS scavenger
N-acetylcysteine reversed GA-induced autophagy and restored the cell survival,
which indicated GA-induced autophagy in NCI-H441 cells through an ROS-dependent
pathway. In addition, in vivo results further indicated that GA significantly
inhibited the growth of NCI-H441 xenografts.
Conclusions: The results shed new light on the interaction between ROS generation
and autophagy in NSCLC cells and provide theoretical support for the usage of GA 
in clinical treatment.

Background: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) have been found to play an important role in the
development and outcomes for multiple human cancers. Their role as a prognostic
biomarker in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. This
meta-analysis aims to clarify the role of various miRNAs in the survival of NSCLC
patients.
Materials and Methods: All studies were identified through medical database
search engines. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the correlation between
miRNAs expressions and overall survival among those NSCLC studies. Relevant data 
were extracted from each eligible study regarding baseline characteristics and
key statistics such as hazard ratio (HR), 95% confidence interval (CI), and P
value, which were utilized to calculate a pooled effect size.
Result: Thirty-two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Using a random
effect model, the combined HR and 95% CI for overall survival (OS) was calculated
as 1.59 (1.39-1.82), predicting a poor overall survival. Five miRNAs (miR-21,
miR-155, miR-let-7, miR-148a, and miR-148b) were found to be of significance for 
predicting OS in at least two studies, hence, selected for subgroup analysis.
Subgroup analysis disclosed that elevated levels of miR-21 and miR-155 in both
cancer tissue and blood samples were associated with worse OS. Compared to
American studies (I-squared: <0.001% and P value: 0.94), Asian and European
studies exhibited greater heterogeneity in miRNA expression and relationship to
OS (I-squared, P values were approximately 78.85%, <0.001 and 61.28%, 0.006,
respectively). These subgroup analyses also highlighted that elevated expression 
of miR-21 and miR-155 and low levels of expression of miR-148a, miR-148b, and
miR-let-7 were associated with poor prognosis in NSCLC.
Conclusion: miR-21, miR-155, miR-148a, miR-148b, and miR-let-7 are consistently
up- or downregulated in NSCLC and are associated with poor OS. These miRNAs show 
potential as useful prognostic biomarkers in the diagnosis, treatment, and
follow-up of NSCLC.

Background: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. Despite
advances in lung cancer therapies, prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer is
still unfavorable. The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic value of 
key genes in lung tumorigenesis.
Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out by GEO2R from
three Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. Common DEGs were selected for Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment
analysis. Protein- protein interaction networks were constructed by the STRING
database and visualized by Cytoscape software. Hub genes, filtered from the
CytoHubba, were validated using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive
Analysis database, and their genomic alterations were identified by performing
the cBioportal. Finally, overall survival analysis of hub genes was performed
using Kaplan-Meier Plotter.
Results: From three datasets, 169 DEGs (70 upregulated and 99 downregulated) were
identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
analyses showed that upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in cell cycle, 
p53 pathway, and extracellular matrix-receptor interactions; the downregulated
DEGs were significantly enriched in PPAR pathway and tyrosine metabolism. The
protein-protein interaction network consisted of 71 nodes and 305 edges,
including 49 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes. The hub genes, including
AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, were overexpressed compared with the
normal group by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis analysis, and
associated with reduced overall survival in lung cancer patients. In the genomic 
alterations analysis, two hotspot mutations (S2021C/F and E314K/V) were
identified in Pfam protein domains.
Conclusion: DEGs, including AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, might be
potential biomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: The EGFR-T790M mutation is clinically detected using re-biopsy in
approximately 50% of patients with acquired resistance to epidermal growth factor
receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) in advanced non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) who harbor EGFR mutations. However, little is known about the
population of NSCLC patients who develop acquired resistance due to the T790M
mutation. In this study, we focused on the emergence of the T790M mutation and
analyzed patients refractory to initial EGFR-TKIs with successful re-biopsy
samples.
METHODS: Seventy-eight advanced NSCLC patients with EGFR mutations who had
successful re-biopsy samples after resistance to initial EGFR-TKI treatment were 
enrolled at 5 institutions in Japan. We validated the association between the
emergence of the T790M mutation and their clinical profiles.
RESULTS: Thirty-nine patients tested positive for T790M and 39 tested negative in
the re-biopsy samples. The objective response rate to initial EGFR-TKIs was
higher in patients with the T790M mutation than in those without the mutation
(89.7% versus 51.2%, p < 0.001). Moreover, there was a significant difference in 
the maximal tumor shrinkage rate relative to baseline in T790M-positive tumors
compared with T790M-negative tumors (42.7% versus 24.0%, p = 0.001). Multivariate
analysis demonstrated that the maximum tumor shrinkage rate was a significant
predictive factor for the detection of the T790M mutation (p = 0.023, odds ratio 
1.03, 95% confidence interval 1.00-1.05).
CONCLUSIONS: Our retrospective observations suggested that the maximum tumor
shrinkage rate with initial EGFR-TKI treatment might be one of the promising
predictive biomarkers for emerging refractory tumors with the EGFR-T790M
mutation.

lncRNA SNHG8 Promotes the Tumorigenesis and Metastasis by Sponging miR-149-5p and
Predicts Tumor Recurrence in Hepatocellular Carcinoma.

Dong J, Teng F, Guo W, Yang J, Ding G, Fu Z.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are aberrantly expressed in
multiple malignant tumors involved in tumor growth and metastasis. Accumulating
data show that small nucleolar RNA host gene (SNHG) 1/12/20 plays a key role in
the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, the molecular
mechanisms by which SNHG8 contributes to HCC remain elusive and merit
exploration.
METHODS: The association between SNHG8 expression and the clinicopathological
characteristics and prognoses in HCC patients was analysed by using qRT-PCR
analysis and the data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Cell growth and metastatic
potential were determined by MTT, colony formation, Transwell assays, and the
mouse xenograft tumor model and lung metastasis model. Epithelial-mesenchymal
transition markers were detected by western blot analysis. The binding capacity
of SNHG8 with miRNAs was evidenced by bioinformatic analysis and a luciferase
reporter assay. In addition, the rescue experiments were performed based on
co-transfection with sh-SNHG8 and a miR-149 inhibitor in HCC cells.
RESULTS: The expression levels of lncRNA SNHG8 were dramatically increased in HCC
tissues and cell lines as compared with the adjacent normal tissues, and SNHG8
expression was an independent prognostic factor of tumor recurrence in HCC
patients. Furthermore, knockdown of SNHG8 inhibited cell proliferation, invasion,
and lung metastasis in vitro and in vivo, whereas overexpression of SNHG8
reversed these effects. SNHG8 acted as a sponge of miR-149 and counteracted the
tumor suppressive effects of mi R-149 in HCC cells. Expression of phosphatase,
Mg2+/Mn2+ dependent 1F, a target of R-149, displayed a negative correlation with 
miR-149 expression but a positive correlation with SNHG8 expression in HCC
specimens.
CONCLUSION: As lncRNA SNHG8 may promote HCC tumorigenesis and metastasis by
sponging miR-149, it is a potential candidate marker and therapeutic target for
HCC.

Son of sevenless (SOS) is one of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors that can
regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated
kinase signal pathway via controlling the activation of Ras. microRNAs are key
regulon of gene expression and would be treated as tumor biomarkers or
therapeutic targets. In this study, we find that miR-148a-3p acts as a
tumor-suppressor in the development and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). miR-148a-3p inhibits NSCLC cells proliferation and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing the expression of SOS2, which
refers Ras activating. Our findings demonstrate that the miR-148a-3p may play a
significant role in NSCLC including the kind of lung cancer with K-Ras gene
mutation, and it exerted the tumor inhibitor function by targeting SOS2. Because 
of that, miR-148a-3p and SOS2 may be an efficient target in developing more
useful therapies against NSCLC.

Patients with EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) exhibit resistance 
to EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) within 9-14 months of therapy.
Recently, EGFR-mutated NSCLC has demonstrated the potential for heterogeneity;
therefore, the manner of clonal heterogeneity may impact the duration of
progression-free and overall survival and other parameters affecting EGFR-TKI
treatment efficacy. However no predictive biomarker of these favorable treatment 
efficacies has been identified to date. The exosome-focused translational
research for afatinib (EXTRA) study aims to identify a novel predictive biomarker
and a resistance marker for afatinib by analyzing data from association studies
of the clinical efficacy of afatinib and four "OMICs" (genomics, proteomics,
epigenomics, and metabolomics) using peripheral blood from patients treated with 
afatinib. This study aims to: (i) conduct comprehensive multi-OMIC analyses in a 
prospective clinical trial, and (ii) focus on both sera/plasma and exosome as a
source for OMIC analyses to identify a novel predictor of the efficacy of a
specific drug. To eliminate the carryover bias of prior treatment, systemic
treatment-naïve patients were enrolled. The candidates to be screened for
biomarkers comprise a discovery cohort of 60 patients and an independent
validation cohort of 40 patients. The EXTRA study is the first trial to screen
novel biomarkers of longer treatment efficacy of EGFR-TKIs using four-OMICs
analyses, focusing on both "naked or free" molecules and "capsulated" exosomal
components in serially collected peripheral blood.

Pulmonary fibrosis represents a leading cause of morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Therapy induced lung fibrosis constitutes a pivotal dose-limiting side
effect of radiotherapy and other anticancer agents. We aimed to develop objective
criteria for assessment of fibrosis and discover pathophysiological and molecular
correlates of lung fibrosis as a function of fractionated whole thoracic
irradiation. Dose-response series of fractionated irradiation was utilized to
develop a non-invasive and quantitative measure for the degree of fibrosis - the 
fibrosis index (FI). The correlation of FI with histopathology, blood-gas,
transcriptome and proteome responses of the lung tissue was analyzed. Macrophages
infiltration and polarization was assessed by immunohistochemistry. Fibrosis
development followed a slow kinetic with maximum lung fibrosis levels detected at
24-week post radiation insult. FI favorably correlated with radiation dose and
surrogates of lung fibrosis i.e., enhanced pro-inflammatory response, tissue
remodeling and extracellular matrix deposition. The loss of lung architecture
correlated with decreased epithelial marker, loss of microvascular integrity with
decreased endothelial and elevated mesenchymal markers. Lung fibrosis was further
attributed to a switch of the inflammatory state toward a macrophage/T-helper
cell type 2-like (M2/Th2) polarized phenotype. Together, the multiscale
characterization of FI in radiation-induced lung fibrosis (RILF) model identified
pathophysiological, transcriptional and proteomic correlates of fibrosis.
Pathological immune response and endothelial/epithelial to mesenchymal transition
were discovered as critical events governing lung tissue remodeling. FI will be
instrumental for deciphering the molecular mechanisms governing lung fibrosis and
discovery of novel targets for treatment of this devastating disease with an
unmet medical need.

The need for a liquid biopsy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients is
rapidly increasing. We studied the relation between overall survival (OS) and the
presence of four cancer biomarkers from a single blood draw in advanced NSCLC
patients: EpCAMhigh circulating tumor cells (CTC), EpCAMlow CTC, tumor-derived
extracellular vesicles (tdEV) and cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA).
EpCAMhigh CTC were detected with CellSearch, tdEV in the CellSearch images and
EpCAMlow CTC with filtration after CellSearch. ctDNA was isolated from plasma and
mutations present in the primary tumor were tracked with deep sequencing methods.
In 97 patients, 21% had ≥2 EpCAMhigh CTC, 15% had ≥2 EpCAMlow CTC, 27% had ≥18
tdEV and 19% had ctDNA with ≥10% mutant allele frequency. Either one of these
four biomarkers could be detected in 45% of the patients and all biomarkers were 
present in 2%. In 11 out of 16 patients (69%) mutations were detected in the
ctDNA. Two or more unfavorable biomarkers were associated with poor OS. The
presence of EpCAMhigh CTC and elevated levels of tdEV and ctDNA was associated
with a poor OS; however, the presence of EpCAMlow CTC was not. This single tube
approach enables simultaneous analysis of multiple biomarkers to explore their
potential as a liquid biopsy.

Emerging evidences have revealed tumor-specific gene methylation is considered to
be a promising non-invasive biomarker for many different types of cancers. This
study was determined whether TMEM196 gene hypermethylation and downregulation are
considered to be promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in lung
cancer. Methylation status was detected with methylation-specific PCR.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were used to determine
the significance of prognosis. TMEM196 gene was hypermethylated in 68.1% (64/94) 
of lung cancer tissues, 52.8% (67/127) of plasma and 55.2% (79/143) of sputum
samples, but unmethylated (0/50) in normal tissues. TMEM196 methylation in plasma
and sputum samples was significantly correlated with that in the corresponding
paired tumor tissues (r = 0.750, r = 0.880, P < 0.001). TMEM196 aberrant
methylation in cancer tissues, plasma and sputum DNA was significantly associated
with age and pathological type (P < 0.05). TMEM196 high methylation could
robustly distinguish lung cancer patients (AUC = 0.905) from normal subjects and 
patients with TMEM196 high methylation have a significantly poorer survival than 
those with low level from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Wilcoxon P < 0.001).
Multivariate models showed TMEM196 methylation is an independent prognostic
marker in lung cancer. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with low
TMEM196 expression was significantly poorer than that of TMEM196-high patients
(P < 0.001, log-rank test). Low TMEM196 expression in tumor tissues was found to 
predict poorer survival (HR = 3.007; 95%CI, 1.918-4.714). Our study provided new 
insights into the clinical importance and potential use of TMEM196 methylation
and expression as novel early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human lung
cancers.

OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important
roles in tumor development and progression. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the role of miR-582-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying its action.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using quantitative RT-PCR, we detected miR-582-5p
expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of
miR-582-5p expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was
statistically analyzed. The effect of miR-582-5p on proliferation was evaluated
by CCK-8. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay.
miR-582-5p target genes were confirmed using luciferase activity, RT-PCR and
Western blot assays.
RESULTS: We found that miR-582-5p expression was significantly downregulated in
NSCLC cell lines and clinical specimens. Low miR-582-5p expression was
significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012) and advanced TNM 
stage (p = 0.004). Kaplan-Meier assay showed that patients with low expression of
miR-582-5p had a shorter overall survival than those with high expression of
miR-582-5p (p = 0.0033). Functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression 
of miR-582-5p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells
in vitro. We identified MAP3K2 as a direct target gene of miR-582-5p in NSCLC
cells. In addition, ectopic expression of MAP3K2 restored the effects of
miR-582-5p on NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that miR-582-5p inhibits NSCLC metastasis by targeting
MAP3K2 expression and could be used as an independent prognostic biomarker for
patients with NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Identification of differentially expressed genes, i.e., genes whose
transcript abundance level differs across different biological or physiological
conditions, was indeed a challenging task. However, the inception of
transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) technology revolutionized the simultaneous
measurement of the transcript abundance levels for thousands of genes.
OBJECTIVE: In this paper, such next-generation sequencing (NGS) data is used to
identify biomarker signatures for several of the most common cancer types
(bladder, colon, kidney, brain, liver, lung, prostate, skin, and thyroid)
METHODS: Here, the problem is mapped into the comparison of optimization
algorithms for selecting a set of genes that lead to the highest classification
accuracy of a two-class classification task between healthy and tumor samples. As
the optimization algorithms Artificial Bee Colony (ABC), Ant Colony Optimization,
Differential Evolution, and Particle Swarm Optimization are chosen for this
experiment. A standard statistical method called DESeq2 is used to select
differentially expressed genes before being feed to the optimization algorithms. 
Classification of healthy and tumor samples is done by support vector machine
RESULTS: Cancer-specific validation yields remarkably good results in terms of
accuracy. Highest classification accuracy is achieved by the ABC algorithm for
Brain lower grade glioma data is 99.10%. This validation is well supported by a
statistical test, gene ontology enrichment analysis, and KEGG pathway enrichment 
analysis for each cancer biomarker signature CONCLUSION: The current study
identified robust genes as biomarker signatures and these identified biomarkers
might be helpful to accurately identify tumors of unknown origin.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological subtype of lung
cancer. Previous studies have found that many microRNAs (miRNAs), including
miRNA‑126‑3p, may play a critical role in the development of LUAD. However, no
study of LUAD has researched the synergistic effects and co‑targets of both
miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p. The present study used real‑time quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR) to explore the expression values of
miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p in 101 LUAD and 101 normal lung tissues. Ten
relevant microarray datasets were screened to further validate the expression
levels of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p in LUAD. Twelve prediction tools were employed to 
obtain potential targets of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p. The results showed
that both miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p were expressed significantly lower in LUAD. A
significant positive correlation was also present between miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p
expression in LUAD. In addition, lower expression of miRNA‑126‑3p and ‑5p was
indicative of vascular invasion, lymph node metastasis (LNM), and a later
tumor/node/metastasis (TNM) stage of LUAD. The authors obtained 167 targets of
miRNA‑126‑3p and 212 targets of miRNA‑126‑5p; 44 targets were co‑targets of both.
Eight co‑target genes (IGF2BP1, TRPM8, DUSP4, SOX11, PLOD2, LIN28A, LIN28B and
SLC7A11) were initially identified as key genes in LUAD. The results of the
present study indicated that the co‑regulation of miRNA‑126‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p
plays a key role in the development of LUAD, which also suggests a fail‑proof
mode between miRNA‑3p and miRNA‑126‑5p.

Galectin‑3 plays crucial roles in tumor progression. However, in non‑small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC), it remains unclear whether the hypoxic tumor
microenvironment enhances galectin‑3‑induced cell motility. We investigated
galectin‑3 expression in NSCLC cells under hypoxia, and the possible molecular
mechanisms by which galectin‑3 influences tumor aggressiveness. Galectin‑3 levels
in NSCLC cell lines under hypoxia were assessed using reverse transcription PCR
and western blotting. To clarify the role of endogenous galectin‑3, the effect of
galectin‑3 knockdown in NSCLC cells was investigated using scratch and invasion
assays. The expression and clinicopathological significance of galectin‑3 in 57
patients with pN0M0 invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma were investigated by
immunohistochemistry. Both mRNA and protein levels of galectin‑3 in the NSCLC
cell lines A549 and LK‑2 were upregulated by hypoxia. As revealed by scratch and 
invasion assays, the cell migratory and invasive activities were significantly
increased under hypoxia, but were reduced by galectin‑3 knockdown. Notably,
addition of galectin‑3 to the media did not improve the cell motility impaired by
galectin‑3 knockdown. To clarify the role of endogenous galectin‑3 in the
enhancement of tumor cell motility under hypoxia, we focused on the function of
RhoA. RhoA level in the plasma membrane, but not in the cytoplasm, was increased 
under hypoxia and decreased by galectin‑3 knockdown. RhoA activity was
significantly enhanced under hypoxia and effectively inhibited by galectin‑3
knockdown. In patients with pN0M0 invasive pulmonary adenocarcinoma, higher
galectin‑3 expression on tumor cells was significantly associated with tumor cell
invasion into microvessels and tumor recurrence after surgery. These data
demonstrate that in NSCLC cells under hypoxia, upregulated galectin‑3 levels
increase the localization of RhoA to the plasma membrane, thus enhancing RhoA
activity, which is associated with aggressive cell motility. In pN0M0 invasive
pulmonary adenocarcinoma, galectin‑3 is a potential biomarker for predicting
tumor recurrence after radical surgery.

BACKGROUND: Approximately 30% of tumor biopsies from patients with advanced-stage
lung adenocarcinomas yield insufficient tissue for successful molecular
subtyping. We have analyzed the clinical utility of next-generation sequencing
(NGS) of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with inadequate
tumor samples for tissue genotyping.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted the study in a multi-institutional prospective
cohort of clinically unselected patients with advanced-stage lung adenocarcinomas
with insufficient tissue for EGFR, ALK or ROS1 genotyping across 12 Spanish
institutions (n = 93). ctDNA NGS was carried out by Guardant Health (Guardant360,
Redwood City, CA), using a hybrid-capture-based 73-gene panel. Variants were
deemed actionable if they were part of the OncoKB precision oncology knowledge
database and classified in four levels of actionability based on their clinical
or preclinical evidence for drug response.
RESULTS: Eighty-three out of 93 patients (89%) had detectable levels of ctDNA.
Potentially actionable level 1-4 genomic alterations were detected in 53 cases
(57%), of which 13 (14%) had level 1-2A alterations (Food and Drug
Administration-approved and standard-care biomarkers according to lung cancer
guidelines). Frequencies of each genomic alteration in ctDNA were consistent with
those observed in unselected pulmonary adenocarcinomas. The majority of the
patients (62%), particularly those with actionable alterations (87%), had more
than one pathogenic variant in ctDNA. The median turnaround time to genomic
results was 13 days. Twelve patients (13%) received genotype-matched therapies
based on ctDNA results, deriving the expected clinical benefit. Patients with
co-occurring pathogenic alterations had a significantly shorter median overall
survival as compared with patients without co-occurring pathogenic alteration
(multivariate hazard ratio = 5.35, P = 0.01).
CONCLUSION: Digital NGS of ctDNA in lung cancers with insufficient tumor samples 
for tissue sequencing detects actionable variants that frequently co-occur with
other potentially clinically relevant genomic alterations, allowing timely
initiation of genotype-matched therapies.

Bi-directional signaling involved in radiation-induced bystander effect (RIBE)
between irradiated carcinoma cells and their surrounding non-irradiated normal
cells is relevant to radiation cancer therapy. Using the SPICE-NIRS microbeam, we
delivered 500 protons to A549-GFP lung carcinoma cells, stably expressing
H2B-GFP, which were co-cultured with normal WI-38 cells. The level of γ-H2AX, a
marker for DNA double-strand breaks (DSB), was subsequently measured up to 24-h
post-irradiation in both targeted and bystander cells. As a result, inhibition of
gap junction intercellular communication (GJIC) attenuated DSB repair in targeted
A549-GFP cells, and suppressed RIBE in bystander WI-38 cells but not in distant
A549-GFP cells. This suggests that GJIC plays a two-way role through propagating 
DNA damage effect between carcinoma to normal cells and reversing the bystander
signaling, also called 'rescue effect' from bystander cells to irradiated cells, 
to enhance the DSB repair in targeted cells.

Background: Lung cancer is a severe cancer with a high death rate. The 5-year
survival rate for stage III lung cancer is much lower than stage I. Early
detection and intervention of lung cancer patients can significantly increase
their survival time. However, conventional lung cancer-screening methods, such as
chest X-rays, sputum cytology, positron-emission tomography (PET), low-dose
computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, and gene-mutation,
-methylation, and -expression biomarkers of lung tissue, are invasive,
radiational, or expensive. Liquid biopsy is non-invasive and does little harm to 
the body. It can reflect early-stage dysfunctions of tumorigenesis and enable
early detection and intervention.
Methods: In this study, we analyzed RNA-sequencing data of tumor-educated
platelets (TEPs) in 402 non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients and 231
healthy controls. A total of 48 biomarker genes were selected with advanced
minimal-redundancy, maximal-relevance, and incremental feature-selection (IFS)
methods.
Results: A support vector-machine (SVM) classifier based on the 48 biomarker
genes accurately predicted NSCLC with leave-one-out cross-validation (LOOCV)
sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and Matthews correlation coefficients of
0.925, 0.827, 0.889, and 0.760, respectively. Network analysis of the 48 genes
revealed that the WASF1 actin cytoskeleton module, PRKAB2 kinase module, RSRC1
ribosomal protein module, PDHB carbohydrate-metabolism module, and three
intermodule hubs (TPM2, MYL9, and PPP1R12C) may play important roles in NSCLC
tumorigenesis and progression.
Conclusion: The 48-gene TEP liquid-biopsy biomarkers will facilitate early
screening of NSCLC and prolong the survival of cancer patients.

Lung cancer is a major global health problem, as it is the leading cause of
cancer-related deaths worldwide. Major advances in the identification of key
mutational alterations have led to the development of molecularly targeted
therapies, whose efficacy has been limited by emergence of resistance mechanisms.
US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved therapies targeting angiogenesis
and more recently immune checkpoints have reinvigorated enthusiasm in elucidating
the prognostic and pathophysiological roles of the tumour microenvironment in
lung cancer. In this Review, we highlight recent advances and emerging concepts
for how the tumour-reprogrammed lung microenvironment promotes both primary lung 
tumours and lung metastasis from extrapulmonary neoplasms by contributing to
inflammation, angiogenesis, immune modulation and response to therapies. We also 
discuss the potential of understanding tumour microenvironmental processes to
identify biomarkers of clinical utility and to develop novel targeted therapies
against lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Checkpoint inhibitors (CIs) are highly effective but can induce
severe immune-related adverse events (irAEs), which cannot be predicted. We
investigated whether human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genes predispose to developing
of irAEs during therapy and thus hold a predictive role.
METHODS: We established a prospective observational single-centre study and
collected data from patients with either metastatic non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) or metastatic melanoma, who were treated with anti-PD-1 (programmed cell 
death receptor 1), anti-CTLA4 (cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated protein 4) or
both CIs combined. Data include irAEs and ranges from 15th July 2016 until 10th
May 2018. In addition, we performed HLA typing via next generation sequencing.
RESULTS: We enrolled 102 patients (median [range] age, 68 [62-74] years) with
metastatic cancer in our study who received CI therapy. Of these patients, 59
(58%) developed one or more irAEs, among which pruritus (n = 32 (54%)) and rash
(n = 24 (41%)) had the highest rates. We did not find evidence for a single HLA
gene being associated with all irAEs (all P > .05). When assessing each irAE
individually, we found a significant association between HLA-DRB1*11:01 and
pruritus (OR = 4.53, X21,95 = 9.45, P < .01) as well as a nominally significant
additive association between HLA-DQB1*03:01 and colitis (OR = 3.94,
X21,95 = 5.67, P = .017).
CONCLUSIONS: The presence of two HLA alleles that are known to predispose to
autoimmune diseases were associated with the development of pruritus or colitis
during therapy, suggesting a genetic aetiology of irAEs. Larger genome-wide
association studies should be performed to confirm our findings.

The present review is an update of the research and development efforts regarding
the use of molecular biomarkers in the lung cancer screening setting. The two
main unmet clinical needs, namely, the refinement of risk to improve the
selection of individuals undergoing screening and the characterization of
undetermined nodules found during the computed tomography-based screening process
are the object of the biomarkers described in the present review. We first
propose some principles to optimize lung cancer biomarker discovery projects.
Then, we summarize the discovery and developmental status of currently promising 
molecular candidates, such as autoantibodies, complement fragments, microRNAs,
circulating tumor DNA, DNA methylation, blood protein profiling, or RNA airway or
nasal signatures. We also mention other emerging biomarkers or new technologies
to follow, such as exhaled breath biomarkers, metabolomics, sputum cell imaging, 
genetic predisposition studies, and the integration of next-generation sequencing
into study of circulating DNA. We also underline the importance of integrating
different molecular technologies together with imaging, radiomics, and artificial
intelligence. We list a number of completed, ongoing, or planned trials to show
the clinical utility of molecular biomarkers. Finally, we comment on future
research challenges in the field of biomarkers in the context of lung cancer
screening and propose a design of a trial to test the clinical utility of one or 
several candidate biomarkers.

Immune checkpoint blockade has been a pivotal development in the management of
advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although durable antitumour activity
and improved survival have been observed in a subset of patients, there is a need
for additional predictive biomarkers to improve patient selection and avoid
toxicity in potential non-responders. This review will address the use and
limitations of tumour programmed death-ligand 1 expression as a predictive
biomarker and review emerging biomarker strategies specifically related to NSCLC 
including genetic alterations (tumour mutation burden, loss and gain activated
mutations), tumour-related factors (tumour microenvironment) and factors related 
to the host immune system. Novel approaches in biomarker detection such as
peripheral blood monitoring will also be reviewed.

BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) and anti-programmed cell death
ligand 1 (PD-L1) antibodies are novel immunotherapies for cancer that can induce 
immune-related adverse events (irAEs). These adverse events can involve all
organs, including the haemopoietic system. Thus far, haematological irAEs
(haem-irAEs) have not been extensively characterised. This study aims to provide 
a comprehensive report of the haem-irAEs induced by anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1.
METHODS: In this descriptive observational study, we included consecutive
patients aged at least 18 years with grade 2 or worse haem-irAEs induced by
anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy registered in three French
pharmacovigilance databases: the Registre des Effets Indésirables Sévères des
Anticorps Monoclonaux Immunomodulateurs en Cancérologie (REISAMIC; a prospective 
registry of patients treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 at a single centre),
the ImmunoTOX committee of Gustave Roussy (a national referral database of
suspected irAEs in patients treated with immunotherapy), and the registry of the 
Centre de Référence des Cytopénies Auto-Immunes de l'Adulte (CeReCAI; a national 
database of autoimmune cytopenias). Cases were reviewed by a central committee;
adverse events had to be classed as certainly or probably related to anti-PD-1 or
anti-PD-L1 therapy, and their severity was assessed according to the Common
Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). The primary endpoint was 
clinical description of haem-irAEs, as reported in all databases, and their
frequency, as reported in the prospective REISAMIC registry.
FINDINGS: We screened 948 patients registered in the three databases from June
27, 2014, to June 29, 2018 (745 from REISAMIC, 190 from the ImmunoTOX committee, 
and 13 from CeReCAI). 35 patients (21 men and 14 women) with haem-irAEs related
to anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1 were included in the study. Of 745 patients in the
REISAMIC registry treated with anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1, four had haem-irAEs,
giving a frequency of 0·5%. Median age in the 35 patients was 65 years (IQR
51-75), and the most common tumour types were melanoma (15 [43%] patients),
non-small-cell lung cancer (12 [34%] patients), and lymphoma (four [11%]
patients). 20 (57%) patients received nivolumab, 14 (40%) received pembrolizumab,
and one (3%) received atezolizumab. Among the 35 patients, neutropenia,
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, and immune thrombocytopenia were the most common
types of haem-irAE (each in nine patients [26%]), followed by pancytopenia or
aplastic anaemia (five patients [14%]), bicytopenia (one patients with
thrombocytopenia plus anaemia and one patient with neutropenia plus anaemia
[6%]), and pure red cell aplasia (one patient [3%]). The maximum grade of
severity was grade 2 in three (9%) patients, grade 3 in five (14%) patients, and 
grade 4 in 25 (71%) patients; two (6%) patients died from febrile neutropenia
during haem-irAE related to anti-PD-1. Haem-irAEs resolved in 21 (60%) of the 35 
patients.
INTERPRETATION: Haem-irAEs induced by PD-1 or PD-L1 inhibitors are rare but
potentially life-threatening events. The most common clinical presentations are
neutropenia, autoimmune haemolytic anaemia, immune thrombocytopenia, and aplastic
anaemia. Investigations into earlier detection and better management are
warranted.

OBJECTIVE: The antifolate chemotherapy agent pemetrexed has been widely used to
treat non-small-cell-lung-cancer (NSCLC), but there is no clinically validated
biomarker to select patients likely to respond. The aim of this study was to
assess two proteins involved in DNA repair mechanisms, uracil DNA glycosylase
(UDG) and BRCA1 as potential prognostic biomarkers in NSCLC patients treated with
pemetrexed-based chemotherapy.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: Formalin-fixed-paraffin-embedded tumor specimens from 119
patients with advanced NSCLC treated with pemetrexed between 2004 and 2011 were
retrospectively analyzed. Expression of UDG, BRCA1, and known prognostic factors 
ALK, TTF-1, thymidylate synthase and folylpolyglutamate synthase was assessed by 
immunohistochemistry using H-SCORE (product of percent stained cells and
intensity of expression). Progression-free (PFS) and overall survival (OS) served
as reference endpoint.
RESULTS: Most NSCLC tumor samples had UDG positivity in at least 5% of tumor
cells and 34% samples had more than 50% positive tumor cells. Using the median
expression value as threshold, high UDG expression (H-SCORE≥75) was significantly
associated with shorter median PFS (3-year PFS 7% vs. 37%, p = 0.045) and a trend
for shorter OS (3-year OS 15% vs 42%, p = 0.066) compared to patients with low
UDG. In multivariable Cox analysis, the association between high UDG and shorter 
PFS was close to statistically significant (p = 0.08) at a significance level of 
0.05 after controlling for age, gender, ALK- and TTF1-status with hazard ratio of
2.1. Grouping patients according to combined UDG and BRCA1 expression, patients
with a profile of UDGhigh/BRCA1high had the shortest PFS and OS compared to all
other patient groups (p = 0.007 and 0.02, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate an important prognostic role for high UDG
expression in pemetrexed-treated NSCLC patients, in addition to its previously
reported role in pemetrexed cytotoxicity. High UDG expression was predictive of
shorter PFS and OS, and patients with a combined profile of UDGhigh/BRCA1high had
the poorest outcome following pemetrexed treatment.

OBJECTIVES: Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is an aggressive tumor with
limited therapeutic options, requiring the development of efficient targeted
therapies based on molecular phenotype of the tumor and to identify predictive
biomarkers of the response.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of inhibitors was investigated by cell
viability assessment on primary MPM cell lines established in our laboratory from
patient tumors, well characterized at the molecular level. Effects on apoptosis, 
cell proliferation and viability on MPM growing in multicellular spheroid were
also assessed for verteporfin. Gene and protein expression, and gene knockdown by
RNA interference were used to define mechanism of inhibition and specific
predictive biomarkers.
RESULTS: Anti-tumor effect of eight major signaling pathways inhibitors involved 
in mesothelial carcinogenesis was investigated. Three inhibitors were more
efficient than cisplatin, the drug used as first-line chemotherapy in patients
with MPM: verteporfin, a putative YAP inhibitor, defactinib, a FAK inhibitor and 
NSC668394, an Ezrin inhibitor. Verteporfin, the most efficient inhibitor, induced
cell proliferation arrest and cell death, and is effective on 3D spheroid
multicellular model. Verteporfin sensitivity was YAP-independent and related to
molecular classification of the tumors. Biomarkers based on gene expression were 
identified to predict accurately sensitivity to these three inhibitors.
CONCLUSION: Our study shows that drug screening on well-characterized MPM cells
allows for the identification of novel potential therapeutic strategies and
defining specific biomarkers predictive of the drug response.

BACKGROUND: EGFR genotyping in pulmonary adenocarcinoma patients who develop
pleural effusions is mostly performed using cytology or cell block slides with
low sensitivity. Liquid biopsy using the supernatant of pleural effusions may be 
more effective because they contain many components released by cancer cells.
Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are known to carry oncogenic double-stranded DNA
that is considered a notable biomarker. Here, we investigate the efficiency of
liquid biopsy using cell-free DNA (cfDNA) and extracellular vesicle-derived DNA
(EV-derived DNA) from the supernatant of pleural effusions for EGFR genotyping in
patients with pulmonary adenocarcinoma.
METHODS: Fifty pleural effusion samples from patients with pulmonary
adenocarcinoma were evaluated. The supernatant, after removing the cell pellet by
centrifugation, was used for liquid biopsy, and EVs were isolated from the
pleural effusion by ultracentrifugation. EV-derived DNA and cfDNA were extracted 
separately, and EGFR genotyping was performed by the PNA clamping method.
RESULTS: Among 32 patients who were EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) naïve
with a known tissue EGFR genotype, liquid biopsy using EV-derived DNA from the
pleural effusion supernatant showed 100% matching results with tissue EGFR
genotyping in 19 EGFR mutant cases and detected three additional EGFR mutations
in patients with wild-type (WT) tissue. Liquid biopsy using cfDNA from pleural
effusion supernatants missed two cases of tissue-based EGFR mutations and found
two additional EGFR mutation cases. In 18 patients who acquired resistance to
EGFR-TKI, EGFR genotyping using EV-derived DNA from the pleural effusion
supernatant detected the T790 M mutation in 13 of 18 (72.2%) patients, and this
mutation was detected in 11 (61.1%) patients using cfDNA. By contrast, only three
patients were found to present the T790 M mutation when using cell block or
cytology slides.
CONCLUSIONS: Liquid biopsy using the supernatant of pleural effusions showed
significantly improved results for EGFR genotyping compared to those using
conventional cell block or cytology samples. Liquid biopsy using EV-derived DNA
is promising for EGFR genotyping, including T790 M detection in pulmonary
adenocarcinoma patients who develop pleural effusions.

BACKGROUND: Many studies have reported the prognostic value of haemoglobin level 
for cancers. Whereas the prognostic impact of decreased pretreatment haemoglobin 
level on the survival of patients with lung cancer remains controversial, herein,
a systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted to investigate whether a
decreased haemoglobin level before treatment is a significant predictor of
survival in patients with lung cancer.
METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational
studies to evaluate the prognostic impact of a decreased haemoglobin level on the
survival of patients with lung cancer. Relevant studies were retrieved from
databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library.
Reference lists were hand-searched for potentially eligible studies. The
Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to assess the quality of included studies.
Observational studies were included if they provided sufficient information for
the extraction of the pooled hazard ratios (HR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CI) for overall survival, disease-free survival, relapse-free survival,
progression-free survival, event-free survival and time to progression. Subgroup 
analysis, meta-regression and sensitivity analyses were applied to explain the
heterogeneity.
RESULTS: Fifty-five articles involving a total of 22,719 patients were obtained
to evaluate the correlation between haemoglobin level and survival. The results
indicated that decreased haemoglobin level was significantly associated with poor
overall survival of patients with lung cancer (HR 1.51, 95% CI 1.42-1.61), both
in non-small cell lung cancer (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.44-1.72) and in small cell lung 
cancer (HR 1.56, 95% CI 1.21-2.02). We also found that the lower the haemoglobin 
level, the shorter was the overall survival of patients with lung cancer (HR
1.11, 95% CI 1.06-1.16). However, the relationship between decreased haemoglobin 
and relapse-free survival was not significant (HR 1.37, 95% CI 0.91-2.05).
CONCLUSION: A decreased pretreatment haemoglobin level among patients with lung
cancer is a prognostic factor of poor survival that can serve as an important
indicator in survival prediction, risk stratification and treatment selection. In
clinical practice, more attention should be paid to monitoring pretreatment
haemoglobin levels among patients with lung cancer.

Exposure to Secondhand Smoke Among Nonsmokers - United States, 1988-2014.

Tsai J, Homa DM, Gentzke AS, Mahoney M, Sharapova SR, Sosnoff CS, Caron KT, Wang 
L, Melstrom PC, Trivers KF.

Exposure to secondhand smoke from burning tobacco products can cause sudden
infant death syndrome, respiratory infections, ear infections, and asthma attacks
in infants and children, and coronary heart disease, stroke, and lung cancer in
adult nonsmokers (1). There is no risk-free level of secondhand smoke exposure
(2). CDC analyzed questionnaire and laboratory data from the National Health and 
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to assess patterns of secondhand smoke
exposure among U.S. nonsmokers. The prevalence of secondhand smoke exposure among
U.S. nonsmokers declined substantially during 1988-2014, from 87.5% to 25.2%.
However, no change in exposure occurred between 2011-2012 and 2013-2014, and an
estimated one in four nonsmokers, or approximately 58 million persons, were still
exposed to secondhand smoke during 2013-2014. Moreover, marked disparities
persisted across population groups. Exposure prevalence was highest among
nonsmokers aged 3-11 years (37.9%), non-Hispanic blacks (50.3%), and those who
were living in poverty (47.9%), in rental housing (38.6%), or with someone who
smoked inside the home (73.0%), or among persons who had less than a high school 
education (30.7%). Comprehensive smoke-free laws and policies for workplaces and 
public places and smoke-free rules for homes and vehicles can further reduce
secondhand smoke exposure among all nonsmokers.

BACKGROUND: Depression is highly prevalent in lung cancer. Although there is a
known association between inflammation and depression, this relationship has not 
been examined in patients with lung cancer who undergo treatment with immune and 
other targeted drug therapies. Peripheral blood C-reactive protein (CRP), a
marker of systemic inflammation, may help identify metastatic lung cancer
patients with inflammation-associated depression.
METHOD: Patients with metastatic lung cancer undergoing treatment were evaluated 
for depression using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS).
Inflammation (CRP and CRP cutoffs ≥1 and ≥3 mg/mL) and demographic and treatment 
variables were analyzed for association with depression.
RESULTS: One hundred nine consecutive participants exhibited an average plasma
CRP concentration of 1.79 mg/mL (median, 0.75 mg/mL [standard deviation, 2.5
mg/mL), and 20.7% had a CRP concentration of ≥3.0 mg/mL; 23.9% met depression
screening criteria (HADS ≥8). A log transformation of CRP was significantly
correlated with depression severity (r = 0.47, P < .001). CRP was the only
covariate to predict depression severity (P = .008) in a multivariate model
including lung cancer disease subtype and type of systemic treatment. Receiver
operating characteristic analysis indicated that CRP had moderate predictive
accuracy in identifying elevated depression (area under the curve = 0.74). A
cutoff of CRP ≥3.0 generated high specificity (88%) but identified only 50% of
those with elevated depression.
CONCLUSION: Elevated CRP is associated with depression in patients with
metastatic lung cancer. Thus, CRP may identify a subset of lung cancer patients
with inflammation-induced depression and may be useful in predicting response to 
treatments that target inflammation or its downstream mediators on the brain.

Inflammation and hyperinsulinemia may drive associations between adiposity and
colorectal cancer (CRC) risk, but few studies have examined this hypothesis using
mediation analysis. We used inverse odds ratio weighting and logistic regression 
to calculate odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for estimated
total effects (ORTE ) of body mass index, waist circumference, and adult weight
gain on CRC risk, and estimated effects operating through seven inflammatory and 
metabolic biomarkers (natural indirect effect; ORNIE ) or through paths
independent of these biomarkers (natural direct effect; ORNDE ) among 209 CRC
cases and 382 matched controls nested within the Health Professionals Follow-up
Study, a prospective cohort of male health professionals. A one-interquartile
range (IQR) increase in body mass index (3.6 kg/m2 ) was associated with an ORTE 
of 1.40 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.73), which decomposed into an ORNIE of 1.26 (95% CI:
0.97, 1.52) and an ORNDE of 1.11 (0.87, 1.42), with possibly stronger mediation
by these biomarkers for adult weight gain (IQR = 10.4 kg; ORTE = 1.32 [95% CI:
1.06, 1.64]; ORNIE = 1.47 [95% CI: 1.01, 1.81]; ORNDE = 0.89 [95% CI: 0.72,
1.11]), but no mediation for waist circumference. Mediation appeared to be
stronger for the metabolic biomarkers than the inflammatory biomarkers.
Inflammatory and metabolic mechanisms may mediate associations between both body 
mass index and adult weight gain with CRC risk.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is overexpressed in up to 95% of primary
lung adenocarcinoma while negative for almost all squamous cell carcinomas. TTF-1
expression has been investigated as a prognostic factor in non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) with conflicting results. We conducted this meta-analysis to gain 
a better insight into the prognostic role of TTF-1 in patients only with
non-squamous (non-SQ) NSCLC. A systematic computerized search of the electronic
databases including PubMed, PMC, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was
performed. From 21 studies, 6,451 patients were included in the combined analysis
of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival. 
Compared with patients with non-SQ NSCLC showing negative TTF-1 expression, those
with tumors harboring TTF-1 overexpression had significantly better survival (HR 
= 0.49, 95% CI: 0.42-0.57, p < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses revealed that TTF-1
expression significantly correlated with a better prognosis in stage I (HR =
0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.84, p = 0.0008) as well as stage III-IV non-SQ NSCLC (HR =
0.38, 95% CI: 0.29-0.49, p < 0.00001). In conclusion, this meta-analysis
demonstrates that TTF-1 overexpression is a favorable prognostic factor in
patients with non-SQ NSCLC. The subgroup analyses indicate that TTF-1 is a good
prognostic marker for survival not only in early-stage but also in advanced
non-SQ NSCLC.

Background: Prognosis of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer significantly
improved with the availability of checkpoint inhibitors (anti-PD-1/PD-L1).
Unfortunately, reliable biomarkers to predict treatment benefit are lacking.
Patients and methods: We prospectively collected clinical and laboratory data of 
56 non-small cell lung cancer patients treated with a checkpoint inhibitor. The
aim was to identify baseline parameters correlating with worse outcome and to
create a risk score that enabled to stratify patients into different risk groups.
As inflammation is known to promote tumor growth, we focused on inflammation
markers in the blood. Disease control (DC) was defined as complete response,
partial response, and stable disease on CT scan according to RECIST 1.1.
Results: Half of the patients achieved DC. Four parameters differed significantly
between the DC group and the no disease control group: Eastern Cooperative
Oncology Group performance status (P=0.009), number of organs with metastases
(P=0.001), lactate dehydrogenase (P=0.029), and ferritin (P=0.005). A risk score 
defined as the number of these parameters (0= no risk factor) exceeding a
threshold (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status ≥2, number of
organs with metastases ≥4, lactate dehydrogenase ≥262U/L, and ferritin ≥241 µg/L)
was associated with overall survival and progression-free survival. Overall
survival at 6 and 12 months is as follows: Scores 0-1: 95% and 95%; Score 2: 67% 
and ≤33%; Scores 3-4: 15% and 0%. Progression-free survival at 6 and 12 months is
as follows: Scores 0-1: 81% and 50%; Score 2: 25% and ≤25%; Scores 3-4: 0% and
0%.
Conclusion: We propose an easy-to-apply risk score categorizing patients into
different risk groups before treatment start with a PD-1/PD-L1 antibody.

Background: Research indicates that the presence of a systemic inflammatory
response plays an important role in predicting survival in patients with cancer. 
The aim of this study was to investigate the prognostic value of preoperative
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratio (LMR),
platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), prognostic nutritional index, and the
combination of preoperative LMR and PLR (LMR-PLR) in predicting the survival of
patients with stage IB non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Materials and methods: We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 577 patients 
with stage IB NSCLC who underwent pneumonectomy from January 1999 to December
2009. Univariate and multivariate Cox survival analyses were used to evaluate the
prognostic indicators, including LMR-PLR. The cutoff values for LMR and PLR were 
defined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. According 
to the ROC curve, the recommended cutoff values of LMR and PLR were 3.16 and
81.07, respectively. We divided the patients into three groups according to their
LMR and PLR status and defined them with different scores. Patients with both
high LMR (>3.16) and low PLR (≤81.07) were given a score of 2, whereas those with
one or neither were scored 1 or 0, respectively. Survival curves were plotted
using the Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Cox
proportional hazards analyses were used to identify the factors associated with
overall survival (OS).
Results: The median follow-up time was 93.77 months. The allocation of the
LMR-PLR score was as follows: LMR-PLR = 0, 193 (33.4%) patients; LMR-PLR = 1, 308
(53.4%) patients; and LMR-PLR = 2, 76 (13.2%) patients. After multivariate
analysis, our results showed that LMR-PLR was an independent prognostic indicator
for OS (P=0.001). The 10-year OS rates were 70.0%, 60.4%, and 49.5% for LMR-PLR
=2, LMR-PLR =1, and LMR-PLR =0, respectively (P<0.001).
Conclusion: This study demonstrated that preoperative LMR and PLR are simple,
readily available, and low-cost biomarkers. Preoperative LMR-PLR score can be
used as a valuable prognostic marker for long-term survival in stage IB NSCLC
patients who underwent surgery.

Lung cancer has been identified as one of the most prevalent and deadly tumors
worldwide. In recent years, lncRNAs have been demonstrated to play a significant 
role in the development of lung cancer. Specifically, lncRNAs act as a regulator 
of cancer-critical genes, and they regulate the biological behavior of tumors at 
the transcriptional and posttranscriptional levels. Recent studies have shown
that lncRNAs possess great potential in the treatment of non-small cell lung
cancer patients because of their roles in diverse cellular processes, such as
proliferation, metastasis, stem cell maintenance, and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition, and they serve as signaling biomarkers. Compared to other invasive
diagnostic methods, detection of lncRNAs may become a very useful noninvasive
methodology. Moreover, lncRNAs can serve as potential therapeutic targets in
non-small cell lung cancer due to their roles in regulating many signaling
pathways associated with lung carcinoma. In this review, we discuss the roles and
expression profile of lncRNAs. We also discuss the promising application of
lncRNAs as predictors of clinical diagnosis, prognosis, and as potential
therapeutic targets, aiming to demonstrate their practical value for clinical
treatment.

A major part of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with mono- or
multimodal concept develop therapy resistance. Despite the abundance of
biomarkers investigated in the past, there is still a need for valid NSCLC
biomarkers. Glycodelin, an immunosuppressive endometrial protein, has been shown 
to be also expressed in NSCLC. Here, we investigated its potential as a biomarker
in metastatic and advanced stage NSCLC. Glycodelin gene and protein expression
were measured in 28 therapy-naïve resected tumors as well as in corresponding
brain (n = 16) and adrenal gland (n = 12) metastasis by qPCR and IHC. Moreover,
we correlated glycodelin gene expression of cryoconserved therapy-naïve biopsies 
(n = 55) of advanced stage patients with glycodelin serum concentrations and
patient survival. Using follow-up samples of the patients, we monitored
glycodelin serum concentrations during therapy. Glycodelin expression correlated 
between primary tumor and distant metastases within the same patients. The gene
expression of glycodelin in therapy-naïve biopsies also correlated with the serum
concentrations of the patients (r = 0.60). Patients with elevated serum
concentrations showed a tendency in lower overall survival (p = 0.088) and
measuring of glycodelin indicated a progression of the disease earlier compared
to clinical diagnostic. Taken together, we demonstrate that glycodelin is a
promising prognostic and follow-up biomarker for metastatic and advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: The clinical response to anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1)
antibodies in patients with advanced gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) 
cancer in China has not been reported.
METHODS: This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of SHR-1210, an anti-PD-1
antibody, in patients with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer in a phase 1 trial. The
associations between candidate biomarkers (programmed death ligand 1 [PD-L1]
expression, mismatch repair status, tumor mutation load, and lactate
dehydrogenase [LDH] levels) and the efficacy of SHR-1210 were also explored.
RESULTS: Thirty patients with recurrent or metastatic gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma 
who were refractory or intolerant to previous chemotherapy were enrolled between 
June 2, 2016, and June 8, 2017. Seven patients (23.3%) demonstrated objective
responses, including 1 complete response. The objective response rates for
patients with PD-L1-positive and PD-L1-negative tumors were 23.1% (3 of 13) and
26.7% (4 of 15), respectively (P = 1.000). Two treatment-related grade 3 or
higher adverse events were reported: one was grade 3 pruritus, and the other
(3.3%) was grade 5 interstitial lung disease. All 20 patients tested for the
mismatch repair status had mismatch repair-proficient tumors, and the response
rate was 30.0% (95% confidence interval, 11.9%-54.3%). Patients with a higher
mutation load (4 of 10) tended to have better responses than those with fewer
mutations (2 of 10), but the difference was not significant (P = .628). Patients 
with a >10% relative increase from the baseline LDH level were more likely to
experience disease progression (90% [9 of 10]) than patients with a ≤10% change
(40% [8 of 20]; P = .017).
CONCLUSIONS: Anti-PD-1 antibody SHR-1210 shows encouraging efficacy in patients
with advanced gastric/GEJ cancer in China, including mismatch repair-proficient
subgroups.

OBJECTIVES: Neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) has been shown to be a promising
biomarker in several cancers. Prognostic biomarkers are still needed to define
good candidates for lung metastasectomy for colorectal cancer. We aimed to
evaluate the role of NLR.
METHODS: Data from 574 patients who underwent lung metastasectomy for colorectal 
cancer in 3 departments of thoracic surgery from 2004 to 2014 were
retrospectively reviewed. Overall survival (OS) and the time to pulmonary
recurrence (TTPR) were the main end points.
RESULTS: Correlations between NLR and OS (R2 = 0.53), and NLR and TTPR
(R2 = 0.389) were significant (P < 0.0001 for both), with corresponding Pearson R
of -0.728 (P < 0.0001) and -0.624 (P < 0.0001), respectively. A receiver
operating characteristic curve analysis highlighted an NLR cut-off value of 4.05 
as the best predictor of OS and TTPR. NLR ≤4.05 was observed in 238 patients
(41.4%). In the univariable analysis, the median OS was 117 months for patients
with NLR ≤4.05 and decreased to 40 months for patients with NLR >4.05
(P < 0.0001). The median TTPR reached 52 months in case of NLR ≤4.05 and
decreased to 12 months in patients with NLR >4.05. In the multivariable analysis,
NLR ≤4.05 remained an independent favourable prognostic factor on both OS [hazard

In non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the pathologist has contributed to the
development of personalized medicine from the determination of the right
histological type to EGFR and ALK/ROS1 molecular screening for targeted
therapies. With the development of immunotherapies, pathologists intervene
forefront with programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunohistochemical testing,
companion test for pembrolizumab monotherapy, first line and complementary test
to the other programmed cell death-1 (PD-1) PD-L1 inhibitors. Recently, tumor
mutational burden has emerged as a promising tool to evaluate sensitivity to
immunotherapy (IO). The pathologist has a crucial role in the setting of tumor
mutational burden (TMB) testing for the selection and the preparation of the
sample for high throughput molecular analysis, and in the first steps of the
next-generation sequencing (NGS) workflow.

Over the last 20 years there have been great advances in the treatment of lung
cancer. Immune checkpoint blockade together with targeted therapies have provided
oncologists with the means to improve survival of non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) and patients with a better quality of life and therapies with manageable 
toxicity. Maybe in a short period of time the possibility of a cure in metastatic
NSCLC will be raised. Therefore, continued research into new drugs, biomarkers
and especially combination therapies is necessary in order to expand the clinical
benefit of the current treatments to a broader population of NSCLC patients. The 
purpose of our review is to highlight our thoughts about potential mechanisms of 
resistance to immunotherapy that, if better explored, can provide us with both
biomarkers to predict response to these therapies and partners to combine with
and prolong the benefit of immune checkpoint blockade. We are presenting our own 
experience of immunotherapy with a case report from our institution.

The selection of patients for immunotherapy remains challenging given the lack of
highly specific and highly sensitive biomarkers. Nevertheless, it is essential
that testing laboratories are able to fulfil licencing criteria by providing the 
tests which have been validated as providing useful predictive information.
Programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) expression assessment is now established
in routine practice, although the situation regarding the selection of a
particular assay remains complex, and testing protocols are likely to change in
future. It is probable that programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression
assessment will be supplemented in the near future by tumour mutation burden
(TMB), but this will require novel solutions to allow testing to be completed
using small tissue samples and within narrow timeframes. While DNA mismatch
repair (MMR) testing and CD8 T-cell density may also have a role to play in
predicting immunotherapy response, their roles are not well-defined at present.
Above all, the main challenge facing laboratories will be to perform this
multitude of tests alongside the molecular markers already established in
clinical practice [e.g., epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation,
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) translocation, ROS proto-oncogene 1 (ROS1)
translocation]; the challenge for pathologists and clinicians will be to develop 
algorithms which will integrate the complex set of results from these tests and
provide clinically-useful management regimens.

Immune checkpoint inhibition with monoclonal antibodies has emerged as a
promising therapeutic approach but in most tumor types responses are
unpredictable and observed in a minority of treated patients. Positive and
negative predictive biomarkers for efficacy of these costly drugs are desperately
needed. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) for programmed death ligand (PD-L1) expression
in tumor and inflammatory infiltrate has emerged as one predictive biomarker of
some value. However, multiple confounders including those inherent to any IHC and
the unique complexities of the biology of the immune response have limited its
utility. Tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a seemingly more promising 
predictive biomarker for immunotherapy with checkpoint inhibitors in several
tumor types and is likely to be incorporated into future treatment algorithms for
these agents. Given this, the need to define and standardize key parameters of
the most promising biomarkers becomes essential to allow all stakeholders to make
meaningful observations and inferences as to the efficacy of ostensibly similar
agents and combinations in various settings. This review briefly summarizes
approaches to measurement of TMB and ongoing efforts to achieve harmonization of 
this key biomarker.

The introduction in the clinic of immune checkpoint inhibitors (IOs) has
represented an important improvement for the treatment of patients with advanced 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). These drugs have shown a higher activity as
compared with chemotherapy in both first- and second-line of treatment, with some
patients experiencing a long-lasting response. More recently, combinations of IOs
have entered clinical trials in different tumor types including NSCLC.
Nevertheless, IOs are active only in a subgroup of patients and biomarkers for
appropriate patients' selection are urgently needed to offer the patients an
effective therapy, and also to manage the costs. Tumor mutation burden (TMB) has 
powerfully emerged as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy and might enter the
clinic in the next months, although different challenges are still unsolved.
Different methods exist to evaluate TMB in tissue, ranging from whole exome
sequencing (WES) to targeted sequencing of smaller sets of genes, which need to
be fully standardized to ensure that patients receive an appropriate TMB test
with clear clinical interpretation. In addition, as already happened for the
implementation of liquid biopsy testing from NSCLC patients to identify
targetable alterations, researchers are also evaluating the possibility to
calculate TMB in blood, to further enlarge the number of NSCLC patients who may
benefit from immunotherapy. Preliminary data highlight the difficulty to develop 
targeted sequencing panels for the assessment of TMB starting from the
circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA). The applicability of TMB testing on liquid
biopsy needs further investigation and may be clarified within the ongoing
clinical trials.

Immunotherapies based on immune checkpoint inhibitors are emerging as an
innovative treatment for different types of advanced cancers. While the utility
of immune checkpoint inhibitors has been clearly demonstrated, the response rate 
is highly variable across individuals. Due to the cost and toxicity of these
immunotherapies, a critical challenge in this field is the identification of
predictive biomarkers to discriminate which patients may respond to
immunotherapy. Recently, a high tumor mutational burden (TMB) has been identified
as a genetic signature that is associated with a favorable outcome for immune
checkpoint inhibitor therapy. The TMB is defined as the total number of
nonsynonymous mutations per coding area of a tumor genome. Initially, it was
determined using whole exome sequencing, but due to the high costs and long
turnaround time of this method, targeted panel sequencing is currently being
explored to measure TMB. In the near future, TMB evaluation may play an important
role in immuno-oncology, but its implementation in a routine setting involves
robust analytical and clinical validation. Standardization is also needed in
order to make informed decisions about patients. This review presents the
methodologies employed for determining TMB and discusses the factors that may
have an impact on its measurement.

Anti-programmed death (ligand)-1 [anti-PD-(L)1] therapies such as pembrolizumab, 
nivolumab or atezolizumab have become standard of care for non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients either in first line or beyond. PD-L1 expression level
allows enriching the treated population with responders, but it is still not an
optimal biomarker. Even in patients with PD-L1 tumor proportion score (TPS)
levels of ≥50% treated with first line pembrolizumab overall response rate (ORR) 
is only 44.8% and overall survival at one year is 70%. Moreover, in combination
trials with chemotherapy and anti-PD-(L)1 therapy, a significant proportion of
patients does not respond (ORR ranges from 45.3% to 64.0%), regardless of PD-L1
expression. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression level is not associated with improved
benefit in patients treated with combinations of anti-PD-(L)1 and anti-cytotoxic 
T-lymphocyte-associated antigen (anti-CTLA4) therapy. One of the new promising
biomarkers is tumor mutational burden (TMB). It has been discovered that
especially tumor types with a known high mutation rate such as NSCLC and melanoma
respond best to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). An explanation is that this 
high mutation rate makes it more likely that neoantigens arise that are targeted 
by activated immune cells, but it is not feasible to determine neoantigen load in
daily practice. However, TMB of a certain tumor type is associated with
neoantigen load and outcome on ICIs. In this comprehensive review, we discuss the
TMB analysis methods, the rationale to use TMB as a predictive biomarker and the 
clinical utility of TMB in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs.

Despite advances made during the last two decades, lung cancer remains the
leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Recently, immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) became available for the treatment of advanced non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Although ICIs showed a survival advantage in
comparison with chemotherapy in the second and first-line setting, overall
response rate is only around 20% and a large proportion of patients will undergo 
disease progression within the first weeks of treatment. For this reason, there
is a need for biomarkers to predict the efficacy of ICIs in NSCLC and to identify
patients who will benefit from ICIs. The first biomarker developed was programmed
cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression. However, the predictive role of PD-L1
expression varied from one clinical trial to another, due to the multiple assays 
used, with different antibodies, different platforms, and different thresholds.
Moreover, PD-L1 expression is highly heterogeneous. For these reasons, PD-L1
expression alone is not a good biomarker to predict the efficacy of ICIs and
there is a need for the identification of other biomarkers. Tumor mutational
burden (TMB) is defined as the number of mutations per DNA megabases. It was
first assessed as a biomarker for ICI based on the observation of successful
immune checkpoint inhibition in solid tumors with high TMB such as NSCLC,
melanoma or bladder cancer. Pre-clinical data suggested that the association
between TMB and ICIs efficacy could be explained by the creation of neoantigens
induced by mutations acquisition, increasing tumor immunogenicity and response to
ICIs. Preliminary observations of TMB role as a predictive biomarker for the
efficacy of ICIs in patients with advanced NSCLC led to the assessment of TMB
clinical utility in phase III clinical trials. This review reports the clinical
features and prognostic role of TMB in NSCLC. This review also focuses on TMB
predictive role for the treatment of NSCLC patients with single-agent programmed 
cell death 1 (PD-1) and PD-L1 inhibitors such as pembrolizumab, nivolumab and
atezolizumab or ICIs combination.

The emergence of immunotherapy as a first- or second-line of treatment has
revolutionized the therapeutic management of lung cancer patients. However, not
all lung cancer patients receive the same benefit from this treatment, leading to
limitations in the number of patients who can receive anti-PD-1/PD-L1 checkpoint 
inhibitors because some secondary toxicity has been associated with
immunotherapy, and because some patients would benefit more from chemotherapy. In
this context, the selection of patients is currently based on PD-L1
immunohistochemistry (IHC), specifically on the percentage of PD-L1 positive
tumor cells. To date, this is the only validated biomarker that is used as a
companion diagnostic test for immunotherapy in non-small cell carcinoma lung
(NSCLC) patients. However, this biomarker is not sufficiently robust and
demonstrates many challenges. For example, some patients with more than 50% PD-L1
positive tumor cells are non-responders to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 treatment, while
conversely, other patients with no PD-L1 positive tumor cells are good
responders. The tumor mutation burden (TMB) or tumor mutation load (TML) emerged 
recently as a new predictive biomarker for immunotherapy response in NSCLC.
However, this biomarker needs to be validated for routine clinical use and shares
similar constraints with the PD-L1 IHC biomarker. PD-L1 IHC and TMB are currently
the two best predictive biomarkers that could soon be used to systematically
inform treatment decisions in advanced or metastatic NSCLC patients. The aim of
this review is to consider the possible integration of TMB testing in daily
practice through a pros- and cons-debate, and to establish sample
quality-dependent algorithms and the main current constraints for laboratories
considering TMB assessments.

Background: Tumor mutational burden (TMB) is an increasingly important biomarker 
for immune checkpoint inhibitors. Recent publications have described strong
association between high TMB and objective response to mono- and combination
immunotherapies in several cancer types. Existing methods to estimate TMB require
large amount of input DNA, which may not always be available.
Methods: In this study, we develop a method to estimate TMB using the Oncomine
Tumor Mutation Load (TML) Assay with 20 ng of DNA, and we characterize the
performance of this method on various formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
research samples of several cancer types. We measure the analytical performance
of TML workflow through comparison with control samples with known truth, and we 
compare performance with an orthogonal method which uses matched normal sample to
remove germline variants. We perform whole exome sequencing (WES) on a batch of
FFPE samples and compare the WES TMB values with TMB estimates by the TML assay.
Results: In-silico analyses demonstrated the Oncomine TML panel has sufficient
genomic coverage to estimate somatic mutations with a strong correlation
(r2=0.986) to WES. Further, in silico prediction using WES data from three
separate cohorts and comparing with a subset of the WES overlapping with the TML 
panel, confirmed the ability to stratify responders and non-responders to immune 
checkpoint inhibitors with high statistical significance. We found the rate of
somatic mutations with the TML assay on cell lines and control samples were
similar to the known truth. We verified the performance of germline filtering
using only a tumor sample in comparison to a matched tumor-normal experimental
design to remove germline variants. We compared TMB estimates by the TML assay
with that from WES on a batch of FFPE research samples and found high correlation
(r2=0.83). We found biologically interesting tumorigenesis signatures on FFPE
research samples of colorectal cancer (CRC), lung, and melanoma origin. Further, 
we assessed TMB on a cohort of FFPE research samples including lung, colon, and
melanoma tumors to discover the biologically relevant range of TMB values.
Conclusions: These results show that the TML assay targeting a 1.7-Mb genomic
footprint can accurately predict TMB values that are comparable to the WES. The
TML assay workflow incorporates a simple workflow using the Ion GeneStudio S5
System. Further, the AmpliSeq chemistry allows the use of low input DNA to
estimate mutational burden from FFPE samples. This TMB assay enables scalable,
robust research into immuno-oncology biomarkers with scarce samples.

Resident memory T cells (TRM) inhabit peripheral tissues and are critical for
protection against localized infections. Recently, it has become evident that
CD103+ TRM are not only important in combating secondary infections, but also for
the elimination of tumor cells. In several solid cancers, intratumoral CD103+CD8+
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), with TRM properties, are a positive
prognostic marker. To better understand the role of TRM in tumors, we performed a
detailed characterization of CD8+ and CD4+ TIL phenotype and functional
properties in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Frequencies of CD8+ and CD4+ T 
cell infiltrates in tumors were comparable, but we observed a sharp contrast in
TRM ratios compared to surrounding lung tissue. The majority of both CD4+ and
CD8+ TILs expressed CD69 and a subset also expressed CD103, both hallmarks of
TRM. While CD103+CD8+ T cells were enriched in tumors, CD103+CD4+ T cell
frequencies were decreased compared to surrounding lung tissue. Furthermore,
CD103+CD4+ and CD103+CD8+ TILs showed multiple characteristics of TRM, such as
elevated expression of CXCR6 and CD49a, and decreased expression of T-bet and
Eomes. In line with the immunomodulatory role of the tumor microenvironment, CD8+
and CD4+ TILs expressed high levels of inhibitory receptors 2B4, CTLA-4, and
PD-1, with the highest levels found on CD103+ TILs. Strikingly, CD103+CD4+ TILs
were the most potent producers of TNF-α and IFN-γ, while other TIL subsets lacked
such cytokine production. Whereas, CD103+CD4+PD-1low TILs produced the most
effector cytokines, CD103+CD4+PD-1++ and CD69+CD4+PD-1++ TILs produced CXCL13.
Furthermore, a large proportion of TILs expressed co-stimulatory receptors CD27
and CD28, unlike lung TRM, suggesting a less differentiated phenotype. Agonistic 
triggering of these receptors improved cytokine production of CD103+CD4+ and
CD69+CD8+ TILs. Our findings thus provide a rationale to target CD103+CD4+ TILs
and add co-stimulation to current therapies to improve the efficacy of
immunotherapies and cancer vaccines.

BACKGROUND/AIM: While the PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx assay is an FDA-approved diagnostic 
assay for pembrolizumab use, not every pathology laboratory has the Dako
Autostainer to use this assay. Since Ventana BenchMark platforms are more common,
the Ventana SP263 assay can be used to inform treatment decisions involving
nivolumab and pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, some 
studies have shown discordant results between the two assays. This study aimed
was to compare PD-L1 expression using these two assays.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 samples from consecutive cases of resected 
NSCLC were tested using the two PD-L1 assays.
RESULTS: The agreement rates of the two assays were 88-97% at various cut-offs.
There was no significant difference between 22C3 and SP263 in tumour proportion
score (p=0.455).
CONCLUSION: The SP263 assay can be used in the place of the 22C3 assay for PD-L1 
testing, for guiding therapy with PD-1 axis inhibitors in NSCLC.

AIM: To investigate potential associations between clinical and standard
peripheral blood biomarkers and clinical outcome in patients with non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with nivolumab.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 120 patients with advanced NSCLC treated at
seven comprehensive cancer care centers were analyzed in this national
retrospective study. Survival statistics were evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier
method and Cox analysis.
RESULTS: Among clinical parameters, histology was significantly associated with
progression-free survival. Univariate Cox-proportional hazards model indicated
prognostic and predictive role of a panel of laboratory parameters reflecting
chronic inflammatory pattern (elevated neutrophil count, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte
ratio, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, C-reactive protein and decrease in
hemoglobin and albumin). Higher serum calcium concentration was also associated
with nivolumab treatment effect.
CONCLUSION: Tumor histology was the only clinical parameter predicting the
outcome of nivolumab treatment. Among the laboratory parameters, our analysis
identified a laboratory panel reflecting chronic inflammation as a potential
predictive marker of nivolumab treatment.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Cytological analysis for diagnosing malignant pleural effusion
associated with lung adenocarcinoma (Ad-MPE) shows limited sensitivity and novel 
diagnostic biomarkers are needed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
profile of four microRNAs (miRNAs) in exosomes in Ad-MPE and benign
(non-neoplastic) pleural effusion (BPE).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 56 pleural effusion samples from patients with 
lung adenocarcinoma and benign diseases were collected. Exosomal miRNA
expressions were evaluated using real-time quantitative reverse transcription
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: The expression levels of miR-182 and miR-210 were significantly higher
in the Ad-MPE than in the BPE samples. The receiver operating characteristics
curve analyses of miR-182 and miR-210 for diagnosis of Ad-MPE yielded areas under
the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.87 and 0.81, respectively.
CONCLUSION: These miRNA signatures may have a diagnostic potential for
differentiating Ad-MPE from BPE.

Mutational profiling has fundamentally changed our approach to patients with
acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Patients with AML are routinely profiled for the
presence of mutations in FLT3, NPM1, CEBPA, and, more recently, TP53 In this
chapter, we review the role of mutational profiling to help define disease
biology in AML, particularly among patients with putatively intermediate-risk
disease. We describe the body of evidence supporting the utility of mutational
profiling when performed at the time of diagnosis (to identify prognostic and
targetable mutations), at the time of complete remission (to assess minimal
residual disease as a marker for relapse), and at the time of relapse (to
identify therapeutic targets and eligibility for clinical trials). We further
identify particular mutations that have been shown to affect prognosis across the
established European LeukemiaNet risk categories and discuss which mutational
events might be used to alter the approach to patient care at various time points
during the disease course. We also review the evidence in support of molecular
profiling for assessment of minimal/measurable residual disease and describe the 
current landscape of studies designed to validate this approach.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) play a critical role in cancer progression, 
metastasis, and therapy resistance. Molecular events that confer CAF-phenotype to
predecessor-cells are not fully understood. We demonstrate here that the ovarian 
cancer cell-conditioned medium (OCC-CM) induces CAF-phenotype in MRC5
lung-fibroblasts and it can be mimicked by LPA. While OCC-CM and LPA stimulated
the expression of cellular CAF-markers by 3-days, they induced aerobic
glycolysis, a metabolic marker for CAF, by 6 hrs. OCC-CM/LPA-induced glycolysis
in lung (MRC5) as well as ovarian fibroblasts (NOF151) was inhibited by the
LPA-receptor antagonist, Ki16425. Ovarian cancer patient-derived ascitic
fluid-induced aerobic glycolysis in both NFs and Ovarian CAFs and it was
inhibited by Ki16425. Further analysis indicated that LPA upregulated
HIF1α-levels and the silencing of HIF1α attenuated LPA-induced glycolysis in both
NOFs and CAFs. These results establish LPA-induced glycolytic-shift as the
earliest, potentially priming event, in NF to CAF-transition. These findings also
identify a role for LPA-LPAR-HIF1α signaling-hub in the maintenance of the
glycolytic-phenotype in CAFs. Our results provide evidence that targeted
inhibition of LPA-mediated metabolic reprogramming in CAFs may represent an
adjuvant therapy in ovarian cancer.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) is the most common tumor of the pulmonary
pleura. It is a rare and aggressive malignancy, generally associated with
continuous occupational exposure to asbestos. Only a multimodal-approach to
treatment, based on surgical resection, chemotherapy and/or radiation, has shown 
some benefits. However, the survival rate remains low. Nimotuzumab (h-R3), an
anti-EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor) humanized antibody, is proposed as a
promising agent for the treatment of MPM. The aim of this research was to
implement a procedure for nimotuzumab radiolabeling to evaluate its
biodistribution and affinity for EGF (epidermal growth factor) receptors present 
in a mesothelioma xenograft. Nimotuzumab was radiolabeled with 67Ga; radiolabel
efficiency, radiochemical purity, serum stability, and biodistribution were
evaluated. Biodistribution and tumor uptake imaging studies by microSPECT/CT in
mesothelioma xenografts revealed constant nimotuzumab uptake at the tumor site
during the first 48 h after drug administration. In vivo studies using MPM
xenografts showed a significant uptake of this radioimmunoconjugate, which
illustrates its potential as a biomarker that could promote its theranostic use
in patients with MPM.

The metastatic dissemination is a complex multistep process by which tumor cells 
from a primary site enter into the systemic circulation to finally spread at
distant sites. Even if this mechanism is rare at the tumor level, it remains the 
major cause of Osteosarcoma-patients' relapse and mortality. MicroRNAs (miRNAs)
have recently been described as novel epigenetics' genes' expression regulators
actively implicated in cancer progression and dissemination. The understanding of
their implication in the metastatic spreading could help clinicians to improve
the outcome of osteosarcoma. We established the miRNA's expression-profile
between primary bone-tumors (PTs), circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and lung
metastatic (META) samples from in vivo mice xenograft models. Our results show
that the expression level of the miR-198 and -206 was decreased in META samples, 
in which the expression of the metastasis-related receptor C-Met was
up-regulated. Those expression variations were validated in osteosarcoma patient 
biopsies from matching primary tumors and lung metastasis. We validated in vitro 
the endogenous miRNAs inhibitory effects on both migration and invasion, as well 
as we confirmed by luciferase assays that the C-Met receptor is one of their
bona-fide targets. The anti-metastatic effect of these miRNAs was also validated 
in vivo, as their direct injections into the tumors reduce the number of
lung-metastases and prolongs the overall survival of the treated animals. All
together, our results suggest the absence of the miR-198 and -206 as powerful
predictive biomarkers of the tumor cell dissemination and the rationale of their 
potential therapeutic use in the treatment of Osteosarcoma.

ABCC10 Plays a Significant Role in the Transport of Gefitinib and Contributes to 
Acquired Resistance to Gefitinib in NSCLC.

Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(EGFR-TKI), is used clinically as first-line therapy in patients with advanced
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations, but the
inevitable development of acquired resistance limits its efficacy. In up to
30-40% of NSCLC cases, the mechanism underlying acquired resistance remains
unknown. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of membrane
proteins that can significantly influence the bioavailability of numerous drugs, 
and have confirmed to play an essential role in multidrug resistance (MDR) in
cancer chemotherapy. However, their role in acquired resistance to gefitnib in
NSCLC has not been well studied. Here, through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
technology we assessed the differentially expressed ABC transporters in
gefitinib-sensitive (PC9 and H292) and gefitinib-resistant (PC9/GR and H292/GR)
NSCLC cells, with ABCC10 identified as a transporter of interest. Both ABCC10
mRNA and protein were significantly increased in acquired gefitinib-resistant
NSCLC cells, independent of EGFR mutation status. In vitro transport assay showed
that ABCC10 could actively efflux gefitinib, with an efflux ratio (ER) of 7.8.
Further results from in vitro cell line models and in vivo xenograft models
showed that overexpression of ABCC10 led to a reduction in gefitinib sensitivity 
through decreasing the intracellular gefitinib accumulation. Our data suggest
that ABCC10 has an important role in acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC,
which can serve as a novel predictive marker and a potential therapeutic target
in gefitinib treatment.

BACKGROUND: Different histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
show different molecular characteristics and responses to therapeutic strategy.
Identification of specific gene, clarification of its special roles and molecular
mechanisms are crucial for developing new therapeutic approach for particular
subtype patients.
METHODS: Surgical specimens of 540 NSCLC patients were recruited.
Immunohistochemistry was used to detect SOX30 expression, and correlations with
clinical parameters were analyzed. Functional experiments and gene ontology
analysis were performed to investigate roles of SOX30. Network analysis,
TOP/FOP-Flash assays, luciferase reporter assays and ChIP-PCR assays were
performed to determine the mechanism. Survival analyses were calculated by
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Recovery experiment was investigated the
importance of the target of SOX30.
RESULTS: SOX30 expression is closely associated with histological types of NSCLC,
and metastasis of adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients but not of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) patients. SOX30 strongly inhibits cancer cell migration and
invasion in ADC cell lines, whrereas not affects cell migration and invasion in
SCC cell lines. The genes associated with SOX30 preferentially enrich in
metastasis process and Wnt-signaling in only ADC patients. Consistently, SOX30 is
negatively associated with the expression of Wnt-signaling and metastasis-related
gene CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in ADC, but not in SCC. At the molecular level, SOX30
represses Wnt-signaling by directly transcriptional inhibition of CTNNB1 in ADC, 
and also not in SCC. In the clinical, SOX30 is a favorable and independent
prognostic factor in ADC patients, whereas is an unfavorable and independent
prognostic factor in SCC patients. Moreover, SOX30 expression is a double face
early-stage prognostic biomarker in ADC and SCC patients. In addition, forcible
restoration of CTNNB1 indeed can inhibit the anti-metastatic role of SOX30 in ADC
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In early-stage ADC patients, elevated SOX30 expression inhibits
tumor-metastasis by directly binding to CTNNB1 promoter resulting in a favorable 
prognosis of these patients. However, in early-stage SCC patients, SOX30 has no
inhibitory role on tumor-metastasis due to not binding to CTNNB1 promoter leading
to an unfavorable prognosis of the patients. This study highlights a special role
and prognostic value of SOX30 in ADC, providing a novel therapeutic target for
particular subtype NSCLC patients.

Malignant peritoneal mesothelioma (MpM), arising in the setting of local
inflammation, is a rare aggressive tumour with a poor prognosis and limited
therapeutic options. The three major MpM histological variants, epithelioid
(E-MpMs), biphasic, and sarcomatoid MpMs (S-MpMs), are characterised by an
increased aggressiveness and enhanced levels of EZH2 expression. To investigate
the MpM immune contexture along the spectrum of MpM histotypes, an extended in
situ analysis was performed on a series of 14 cases. Tumour-infiltrating immune
cells and their functionality were assessed by immunohistochemistry,
immunofluorescence, qRT-PCR, and flow cytometry analysis. MpMs are featured by a 
complex immune landscape modulated along the spectrum of MpM variants.
Tumour-infiltrating T cells and evidence for pre-existing antitumour immunity are
mainly confined to E-MpMs. However, Th1-related immunological features are
progressively impaired in the more aggressive forms of E-MpMs and completely lost
in S-MpM. Concomitantly, E-MpMs show also signs of active immune suppression,
such as the occurrence of Tregs and Bregs and the expression of the immune
checkpoint inhibitory molecules PD1 and PDL1. This study enriches the rising
rationale for immunotherapy in MpM and points to the E-MpMs as the most
immune-sensitive MpM histotypes, but it also suggests that synergistic
interventions aimed at modifying the tumour microenvironment (TME) should be
considered to make immunotherapy beneficial for these patients.

Purpose: To identify and clarify the roles of inflammatory markers in prognosis
for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Patients and methods: One hundred and twelve adenocarcinoma, clinical stage IV,
NSCLC patients with either EGFR exon 19 deletion (E19del) or EGFR exon 21 L858R
substitution mutation (L858R) were selected for this study. The blood cell count 
at different stages of treatment was used to calculate the inflammatory markers. 
The Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox regression model were used to test the
differences of progression-free survival (PFS) between groups by the optimal
cutoff point of biomarkers.
Results: The median values of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR) in NSCLC patients tended to be reduced after 3 months treated with EGFR TKI
and increased conversely when the disease develops progression (P<0.001). With an
optimal cutoff point of 2.96, NLR is the best prognostic marker in prediction of 
clinical response among the investigated markers (area under the curve
[AUC]=0.873, 95% CI: 0.821-0.926, P<0.001), and it is an independent predictive
marker (OR=3.52, 95% CI: 1.42-8.71, P<0.001). With optimal cutoff point of 0.38, 
MLR is also a predictive marker in response evaluation (AUC=0.762, 95% CI:
0.691-0.832). Univariate analyses have shown that the larger tumor size (>3cm)
and the high level of pretreatment NLR were associated with the shortening of PFS
(HR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.04-4.83, P=0.039 and HR=2.67, 95% CI: 1.41-5.03, P=0.006,
respectively). Multivariate analysis has shown that the elevated NLR is an
independent prognostic marker for worse PFS of NSCLC patients treated with EGFR
TKI (HR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.15-3.99, P=0.016).
Conclusion: NLR and MLR are valuable markers in response evaluation for NSCLC
patients treated with EGFR TKI. The elevated NLR is also an independent
prognostic factor for worse survival.

Background: TRIM37 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Growing evidence has demonstrated
the high value of TRIM37 as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of certain
cancers. However, the biological function of TRIM37 in lung cancer is still
unknown.
Materials and methods: In order to gain a deep insight into the function of
TRIM37 in lung cancer cells, in the present study lentiviral vector was used to
mediate RNA interference and overexpression of TRIM37 in lung cancer cells (H292,
H358, and H1299). In addition, a specific AKT inhibitor LY294002 was utilized to 
examine the correlation between the expression of TRIM37 and AKT.
Results: TRIM37 acts as a positive regulator of cell proliferation in lung cancer
cells. Moreover, cell apoptosis analyses showed the antiapoptosis function of
TRIM37, which was mainly dependent on the regulation of BCL2 and BAX. Our results
also indicated that AKT might be a target of TRIM37 in lung cancer cells.
Conclusion: This research not only helps in understanding the molecular
mechanisms of TRIM37 in detail but also provides evidence to develop novel
biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis.

Here we describe the establishment and characterization of an AR+, PSMA+, ERG+,
PTEN-/-, CHD1+/- patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model termed 'C5', which has
been developed from a 60 years old patient suffering from castration-resistant
prostate cancer (CRPC). The patient underwent radical prostatectomy, showed early
tumor marker PSA recurrence and, one year after surgery, abiraterone resistance. 
Subcutaneous C5 tumors can be serially transplanted between mice and grow within 
~90 days to 1.5-2 cm³ tumors in SCID Balb/c mice (take rate 100%), NOD-scid
IL2Rgnull (NSG) mice (100%) and C57BL/6 pfp-/-/rag2-/- mice (66%). In contrast,
no tumor growth is observed in female mice. C5 tumors can be cryopreserved and
show the same growth characteristics in vivo afterwards. C5 tumor cells do not
grow stably in vitro, neither under two- nor three-dimensional cell culture
conditions. Upon serial transplantation, some C5 tumors spontaneously
disseminated to distant sites with an observable trend towards higher metastatic 
cell loads in scid compared to NSG mice. Lung metastases could be verified by
histology by means of anti-PSMA immunohistochemistry, exclusively demonstrating
single disseminated tumor cells (DTCs) and micro-metastases. Upon surgical
resection of the primary tumors, such pulmonary foci rarely grew out to
multi-cellular metastatic colonies despite doubled overall survival span. In the 
brain and bone marrow, the metastatic cell load present at surgery even
disappeared during the post-surgical period. We provide shallow whole genome
sequencing and whole exome sequencing data of C5 tumors demonstrating the copy
number aberration/ mutation status of this PCa model and proving genomic
stability over several passages. Moreover, we analyzed genomic and transcriptomic
alterations during metastatic progression achieved by serial transplantation.
This study describes a novel PCa PDX model that enables future research on
several aspects of metastatic PCa, particularly for the AR+ , ERG+ , PTEN-/- PCa 
subtype.

Mosaic loss of the Y chromosome (mLOY) in peripheral leukocytes is a somatic
event in which a fraction of leukocytes have lost the entire Y chromosome. The
frequency of mLOY increases with age and may reflect poor genomic maintenance as 
well as clonal imbalances in normal immune function, making mLOY an attractive
candidate marker for cancer risk. Here, we investigated the relationship between 
mLOY and incident cancer in a large sample of 207,603 cancer-free men from the UK
Biobank, in which 13,895 men developed an incident solid tumor during follow-up. 
We identified mLOY by scanning for deviations in genotyping array log R intensity
ratios across the male-specific chromosome Y region. Overall, we detected low
proportions of cells with mLOY in 3,358 (1.6%) men and high proportions of mLOY
in 524 (0.3%) men. We found an association of mLOY with overall solid tumor
incidence using both low and high mLOY thresholds [HRlow = 1.18; 95% confidence
interval (CI)low, 1.07-1.30; P low = 0.001; HRhigh = 1.36; 95% CIhigh, 1.09-1.71;
P high = 0.007] and more specifically we observed an association with lung cancer
(HRhigh = 2.25; 95% CIhigh, 1.36-3.71; P high = 0.002). Stronger associations
were observed without adjustment for smoking, suggesting that smoking is an
important confounder of tumor incidence. It is unlikely that mLOY is a major
mediator of the effect of cigarette smoking on cancer risk, as mLOY was observed 
in only a small fraction of smokers who developed cancer. In summary, mLOY was
modestly associated with incidence of solid tumors in the UK Biobank, although
for some cancer subtypes these findings may reflect residual confounding by
smoking. SIGNIFICANCE: Evidence from the UK Biobank indicates mosaic chromosome Y
loss in leukocytes is moderately associated with increased incidence of select
solid tumors.

Interaction of lncRNA-MALAT1 and miR-124 regulates HBx-induced cancer stem cell
properties in HepG2 through PI3K/Akt signaling.

University, Changsha, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: Hepatitis B virus X protein (HBx) plays a crucial role in initiating 
and promoting HBV-induced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) development. Reports
indicated that HBx promotes cancer stem cell (CSC) generation, which may be
associated with HBV-related HCC. Noncoding RNA miR-124 and long noncoding RNA
(lncRNA)-metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) were
considered to be involved deeply in the progress of HBx-related HCC. Hence, the
underlying mechanism of miR-124 and lncRNA-MALAT1 in regulating HBx-promoted CSC 
needs to be studied.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In present study, HepG2-X cell line was induced by
transfect HBx into HepG2 cells. Overexpressing of miR-124 or silencing of
lncRNA-MALAT1 was completed by transfecting miR-124 mimic or shMALAT1 into
HepG2-X cells. HBx-induced CSC properties and tumorigenic potential of HepG2
cells were determined by detecting CSC marker expression, colony formation assay,
and xenograft tumorigenesis. The mechanism of HBx-induced CSC properties was
explored by PI3K/Akt inhibitor. Interaction of miR-124 and lncRNA-MALAT1 was
detected by luciferase reporter assay.
RESULTS: HBx promoted CSC properties through upregulating stemness markers and
reprogramming proteins, and contributed to tumorigenicity of HepG2-X cells both
in vivo and in vitro. Inhibition of Akt activation blocked the HBx-stimulated
reprogramming proteins and stemness markers. HBx upregulated lncRNA-MALAT1
expression while downregulating miR-124 expression in HepG2-X cells. miR-124
interacts with lncRNA-MALAT1 by direct targeting. Overexpression of miR-124 or
silencing of lncRNA-MALAT1 both blocked HBx-induced CSC generation,
stemness-related factor activation and tumorigenicity via PI3K/Akt signaling.
CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that miR-124 interact with lncRNA-MALAT1 and
involve in regulating HBx-induced CSC properties via PI3K/Akt signaling.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of the lung cancer
cases that have become a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Overexpression
of transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is involved in the inauspicious
development of several types of cancer, including lung tumor aggressiveness. Our 
laboratory has previously found that MED28, a Mediator subunit for
transcriptional activation, modulates cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer cells. The objective
of the current study is to investigate the potential role of MED28 and FOXM1 in
NSCLC. In addition to A549 and PC9 cells, we also used a doxycycline-inducible
system to generate FOXM1-overexpressed A549-DN cells, and we explored the
connection of MED28 with FOXM1 and their effect on migration. Herein, we report
that the increased expression levels of both MED28 and FOXM1 elevated the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a metastasis marker, which
enhanced cell migration and matrigel invasion of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, MED28 
interacted with FOXM1, and both exhibited a mutual effect on the expression and
subcellular localization. Moreover, MED28 small interfering RNA-mediated MMP2
gene suppression could be attenuated by inducible expression of a constitutively 
active form of FOXM1, which consequently restored the migration and invasion
ability of NSCLC cells. Our data indicate that MED28 interacts with FOXM1, and
each affects the expression and localization of the other, and, more importantly,
both regulate MMP2-dependent migration and invasion in human lung cancer cells.

Background: As one of the most common malignant tumors in humans, lung cancer has
experienced a gradual increase in morbidity and mortality. This study examined
prognosis-related methylation-driven genes specific to lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD)
to provide a basis for prognosis prediction and personalized targeted therapy for
LUAD patients.
Methods: The methylation and survival time data from LUAD patients in the TCGA
database were downloaded. The MethylMix algorithm was used to identify the
differential methylation status of LUAD and adjacent tissues based on the
β-mixture model to obtain disease-related methylation-driven genes. A COX
regression model was then used to screen for LUAD prognosis-related
methylation-driven genes, and a linear risk model based on five
methylation-driven gene expression profiles was constructed. A methylation and
gene expression combined survival analysis was performed to further explore the
prognostic value of 5 genes independently.
Results: There were 118 differentially expressed methylation-driven genes in the 
LUAD tissues and adjacent tissues. Five of the genes, CCDC181, PLAU, S1PR1, ELF3,
and KLHDC9, were used to construct a prognostic risk model. Overall, the survival
time was significantly lower in the high-risk group compared with that in the
low-risk group (P < 0.05). In addition, the methylation and gene expression
combined survival analysis found that the combined expression levels of the genes
CCDC181, PLAU, and S1PR1 as well as KLHDC9 alone can be used as independent
prognostic markers or drug targets.
Conclusion: Our findings provide an important bioinformatic basis and relevant
theoretical basis for guiding subsequent LUAD early diagnosis and prognosis
assessments.

Methylation patterns of circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) contain rich
information about recent cell death events in the body. Here, we present an
approach for unbiased determination of the tissue origins of cfDNA, using a
reference methylation atlas of 25 human tissues and cell types. The method is
validated using in silico simulations as well as in vitro mixes of DNA from
different tissue sources at known proportions. We show that plasma cfDNA of
healthy donors originates from white blood cells (55%), erythrocyte progenitors
(30%), vascular endothelial cells (10%) and hepatocytes (1%). Deconvolution of
cfDNA from patients reveals tissue contributions that agree with clinical
findings in sepsis, islet transplantation, cancer of the colon, lung, breast and 
prostate, and cancer of unknown primary. We propose a procedure which can be
easily adapted to study the cellular contributors to cfDNA in many settings,
opening a broad window into healthy and pathologic human tissue dynamics.

BACKGROUND Gemcitabine/cisplatin (GP) resistance displays a negative role in
treating advanced and metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several
studies found that the association existed between platelets and cancer antigen
125 (CA125) with anticancer drugs. But the exact correlation between GP
resistance and platelet activation index remains poorly understood. MATERIAL AND 
METHODS Pre-chemotherapy platelet activation index and CA125 were retrospectively
evaluated in 169 advanced and metastatic NSCLC patients. All variables were
screened by chi-square test and then evaluated by log-rank test. Survival curves 
were generated by Kaplan-Meier analysis. Univariate and multivariate survival
analysis were performed by using Cox proportional hazards model. RESULTS The
overall rate of GP resistance for NSCLC patients was 72.19%. Mean platelet volume
(MPV) and plateletcrit (PCT) are negative predictors of GP resistance
adenocarcinoma [Odds ratio (OR): 5.81, 95% confidence interval (CI):
1.082-31.195, P=0.004] and squamous cell carcinoma (PCT: R: 3.517, 95% CI:
1.087-11.387, P=0.036), respectively. But both were an independent factor
associated with overall survival (OS). Moreover, only CA125 was a dependent
factor associated with OS for squamous cell carcinoma [OS: hazard ratio (HR):
1.741, 95% CI: 1.002-3.024, P=0.049; GP resistance: OR: 4.862, 95% CI:
1.437-16.448, P=0.011]. CONCLUSIONS Platelet activation index will be a potential
marker for predicting GP resistance. Besides, CA125 ≥16.9 could be used as a
potential marker for predicting GP resistance and OS, which was more sensitive
than CA125 ≥35 for squamous cell carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Either chronic or acute exposure to dust particles may lead to
pneumoconiosis and lung cancer, and lung cancer mortality among patients
diagnosed with pneumoconiosis is increasing. Utilizing genome-wide sequencing
technology, this study aimed to identify methods to decrease the number of
patients with pneumoconiosis who die from lung cancer.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-four subjects were recruited, including 54
pneumoconiosis patients and 100 healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated from the
venous blood of every subject. Distinctive miRNAs were identified using high
throughput sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis predicted target
genes involved in lung cancer as well as their corresponding biological
functions. Moreover, cross-cancer alterations of genes related to lung cancer
were investigated, and survival analysis was performed using 2437 samples with an
average follow-up period of 49 months.
RESULTS: Let-7a-5p was revealed to be downregulated by 21.67% in pneumoconiosis. 
Out of the 683 let-7a-5p target genes identified from bioinformatics analysis,
four genes related to five signaling pathways were confirmed to be involved in
lung cancer development. Alterations in these four target genes were then
explored in 4105 lung cancer patients, and BCL2L1 and IGF1R were demonstrated to 
be aberrantly expressed. Survival analysis further revealed that high expression 
of BCL2L1 corresponded to reduced survival of lung cancer patients (HR
(95%CI) = 1.75(1.33~2.30)), while patient survival time was unaffected by
expression of IGF1R (HR (95%CI) = 1.15 (0.98~1.36)).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, simultaneous downregulation of
exosomal let-7a-5p and elevated expression of BCL2L1 are useful as predictive
biomarkers for poor survival.

A 63-year-old man was pointed out with a mediastinal tumor on chest computed
tomography (CT). On positron emission tomography-CT, fluorodeoxyglucose
accumulation with a maximum standardized uptake value of 12.70 was seen in this
tumor. Scar-like nodule was found in the apex of the right lung, but no abnormal 
accumulation was observed in this nodule. The level of carcinoembryonic antigen
was abnormally elevated. We performed mediastinal tumorectomy under thoracoscopic
surgery. Since arterial oxygen saturation fell during intraoperative one-lung
ventilation, we finished the surgery without resection of right apex nodule.
Histologically, mediastinal tumor was diagnosed as metastatic adenocarcinoma in
lymph node. Because immunohistochemical staining suggested lung adenocarcinoma as
the primary site, the right apex nodule was resected. Pathological diagnosis of
this nodule was scar fibrosis. No other malignant lesions were detected, and
therefore we finally diagnosed this tumor as mediastinal lymph node carcinoma of 
unknown primary site. The patient was given adjuvant chemotherapy, and at

Low-dose CT (LDCT) is widely accepted as the preferred method for detecting
pulmonary nodules. However, the determination of whether a nodule is benign or
malignant involves either repeated scans or invasive procedures that sample the
lung tissue. Noninvasive methods to assess these nodules are needed to reduce
unnecessary invasive tests. In this study, we have developed a pulmonary nodule
classifier (PNC) using RNA from whole blood collected in RNA-stabilizing PAXgene 
tubes that addresses this need. Samples were prospectively collected from
high-risk and incidental subjects with a positive lung CT scan. A total of 821
samples from 5 clinical sites were analyzed. Malignant samples were predominantly
stage 1 by pathologic diagnosis and 97% of the benign samples were confirmed by 4
years of follow-up. A panel of diagnostic biomarkers was selected from a subset
of the samples assayed on Illumina microarrays that achieved a ROC-AUC of 0.847
on independent validation. The microarray data were then used to design a
biomarker panel of 559 gene probes to be validated on the clinically tested
NanoString nCounter platform. RNA from 583 patients was used to assess and refine
the NanoString PNC (nPNC), which was then validated on 158 independent samples
(ROC-AUC = 0.825). The nPNC outperformed three clinical algorithms in
discriminating malignant from benign pulmonary nodules ranging from 6-20 mm using
just 41 diagnostic biomarkers. Overall, this platform provides an accurate,
noninvasive method for the diagnosis of pulmonary nodules in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer. SIGNIFICANCE: These findings describe a minimally
invasive and clinically practical pulmonary nodule classifier that has good
diagnostic ability at distinguishing benign from malignant pulmonary nodules.

BACKGROUND: This statewide survey examined differences in cancer-related
knowledge, beliefs, and behaviors between racial and socioeconomic groups in
select counties in Indiana.
METHODS: A stratified random sample of 7,979 people aged 18-75 who lived in one
of 34 Indiana counties with higher cancer mortality rates than the state average,
and were seen at least once in the past year in a statewide health system were
mailed surveys.
RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 970 participants, yielding a 12%
response rate. Black respondents were less likely to perceive they were at risk
for cancer and less worried about getting cancer. Individuals most likely to
perceive that they were unlikely to get cancer were more often black, with low
incomes (less than $20,000) or high incomes ($50,000 or more), or less than a
high school degree. Black women were greater than six times more likely to be
adherent to cervical cancer screening. Higher income was associated with
receiving a sigmoidoscopy in the last 5 years and a lung scan in the past year.
Those with the highest incomes were more likely to engage in physical activity.
Both income and education were inversely related to smoking.
CONCLUSIONS: Socioeconomic and racial disparities were observed in health
behaviors and receipt of cancer screening. Black individuals had less worry about
cancer.
IMPACT: Understanding populations for whom cancer disparities exist and
geographic areas where the cancer burden is disproportionately high is essential 
to decision-making about research priorities and the use of public health
resources.

BACKGROUND: Profound chemoresistance remains an intractable obstacle in
pancreatic cancer treatment. Pancreatic cancer stem cells (CSCs) and the
ubiquitous hypoxic niche have been proposed to account for drug resistance.
However, the mechanism involved requires further exploration. This study
investigated whether the hypoxic niche enhances gemcitabine-induced stemness and 
acquired resistance in pancreatic cancer cells by activating the AKT/Notch1
signaling cascade. The therapeutic effects of blockading this signaling cascade
on gemcitabine-enriched CSCs were also investigated.
METHODS: The expression levels of CSC-associated markers Bmi1 and Sox2 as well as
those of proteins involved in AKT/Notch1 signaling were measured by Western blot 
analysis. The expression level of the pancreatic CSC marker CD24 was measured by 
flow cytometry. Change in gemcitabine sensitivity was evaluated by the MTT assay.
The ability of sphere formation was tested by the sphere-forming assay in stem
cell medium. The ability of migration and invasion was detected by the transwell 
migration/invasion assay. A mouse xenograft model of pancreatic cancer was
established to determine the effect of Notch1 inhibition on the killing effect of
gemcitabine in vivo. The ability of metastasis was investigated by an in vivo
lung metastasis assay.
RESULTS: Gemcitabine promoted pancreatic cancer cell stemness and associated
malignant phenotypes such as enhanced migration, invasion, metastasis, and
chemoresistance. The AKT/Notch1 signaling cascade was activated after gemcitabine
treatment and mediated this process. Blockading this pathway enhanced the killing
effect of gemcitabine in vivo. However, supplementation with hypoxia treatment
synergistically enhanced the AKT/Notch1 signaling pathway and collaboratively
promoted gemcitabine-induced stemness.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate a novel mechanism of acquired gemcitabine
resistance in pancreatic cancer cells through induction of stemness, which was
mediated by the activation of AKT/Notch1 signaling and synergistically aggravated
by the ubiquitous hypoxic niche. Our results might provide new insights for
identifying potential targets for reversing chemoresistance in patients with
pancreatic cancer.

Background: Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women. Multidrug
resistance (MDR) is still a great obstacle of breast cancer chemotherapy. We have
previously shown that multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP1) is
associated with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The lung resistance-related
protein (LRP) is identified as a prognostic marker and response to treatment
factor which has been studied mainly in hematological malignancy and leukemia. In
this study, we aimed to analyze LRP expression and possible correlation between
the expression level of this gene with MRP1 as a candidate marker for
chemotherapy resistance. Materials and Methods: We collected 54 breast tumors and
adjacent normal tissues from Iranian breast cancer patients and Real time RT-PCR 
was employed to measure the gene expression level in our samples. Results: MRP1
and LRP expression level were significantly lower in tumor tissues of the
patients responding to chemotherapy compared to non-responding patients. No
relation between the expression level of either of these genes and
clinicopathology markers was found. Conclusion: Our results suggest that LRP gene
expression is correlated to MRP1 in human breast cancer cells and may affect the 
clinical response to treatment.

The regional cancer registry for Southern Portugal (ROR-Sul) is a
population-based registry set up in 1988 to observe and monitor disease
incidence, prevalence and survival. Recently, the need to monitor real-life use
of early approved and high-priced medicines led to therapeutic effectiveness
becoming an emerging area of interest. We aimed to evaluate the exhaustiveness of
the ROR-Sul database, covering around 4.8 million inhabitants. We have used a
retrospective cohort study comprising 3457 lung cancer cases diagnosed during
2014 and 2015 and extracted from ROR-Sul database. Descriptive analysis of
missing data was undertaken using IBM SPSS software, v.24. Exhaustiveness of data
registry was classified into high (missing values <1%), medium (missing values
{1-15%}) or low (missing values > 15%). High exhaustiveness was found for
patients demographic information, date of diagnosis, date of first medical
appointment, topography, morphology, cancer differentiation, stage of disease and
surgery procedure. Medium exhaustiveness was found for biomarkers (ALK, KRAS, and
EGFR) results, and immunotherapy regimens. Low exhaustiveness was found for
performance status, chemotherapy regimen, and chemotherapy treatment response.
The findings highlight the need to transform treatment variables into compulsory,
so that the cancer registry may be used to support effectiveness studies.
Education, training and behaviour changes must also be considered to foster the
process.

BACKGROUND: The main cause of death in patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) is the progression of cancer metastasis, which can be attributed to
multiple factors, such as cancer stem cells (CSCs) and epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play important roles in the
regulation of the cell cycle, cell proliferation, immune responses, and
metastasis in cancers, but the potential roles and mechanisms of lincRNAs in
CSC-like properties of cancer have not yet been elucidated.
METHODS: Human NSCLC cell lines (A549 and H1299), highly metastatic cell lines
(L9981 and 95D), and their corresponding low-metastatic cell lines (NL9980 and
95C) were subject to quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot, transwell
invasion, colony formation, and wound healing assays.
RESULTS: Linc-ITGB1 was greatly upregulated in CSC spheres. Linc-ITGB1 knockdown 
markedly inhibited CSC formation and the expression of stemness-associated genes,
such as Sox2, Nanog, Oct-4, c-Myc, and CD133. Depletion of linc-ITGB1 expression 
also inhibited the in vitro invasive and migratory potential of cells, and
further analysis indicated that linc-ITGB1 knockdown increased the expression of 
the epithelial marker E-cadherin and downregulated the mesenchymal markers
vimentin and fibronectin. The EMT-related transcription factor Snail mediated
these effects of linc-ITGB1 in NSCLC, and overexpression of Snail significantly
reversed the inhibitory effects of linc-ITGB1 depletion.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study demonstrated that linc-ITGB1 promoted NSCLC cell
EMT and cancer stemness by regulating Snail expression.

Non-small-lung cancer (NSCLC) is the leading cause of cancer death. Early
detection of NSCLC could pave the way for effective therapies. Analysis of
molecular genetic biomarkers in biological fluids has been proposed as a useful
tool for cancer diagnosis. Here, we aimed to develop a panel of noncoding RNAs
(ncRNAs) in sputum for NSCLC early detection. Expression of 11 ncRNAs were
analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction in sputum samples of 30 NSCLC
patients and 30 sex- and age-matched cancer-free controls. Stability of
endogenous microRNAs (miRNAs) in sputum was evaluated after 3 and 6 days at 4°C, 
6 months, and 1 year at -80°C. Nine ncRNAs showed significant differences of
their expression in sputum between NSCLC patients and controls. A logistic
regression model with the best prediction was built based on miR-145, miR-126,
and miR-7. The composite of the three miRNAs produced 90% sensitivity and
specificity in distinguishing NSCLC patients from the controls. Results indicate 
that miRNAs could be useful biomarkers based on their stability under various
storage conditions and maintain differential changes between cancer and control
groups. Moreover, measurement of miRNAs in sputum could be a noninvasive approach
for detection of lung cancer.

The pre-metastatic niche has been shown to play a critical role in tumor
metastasis, and its formation is closely related to the tumor microenvironment.
However, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain unclear. In the present
study, we successfully established a mouse model of lung metastasis using
luciferase-expressing MDA-MB-435s cells. In this model, recruitment of vascular
endothelial growth factor receptor-1 (VEGFR1)+CD133+ hematopoietic progenitor
cells (HPCs) was gradually increased in lung but gradually decreased after the
formation of tumor colonies in lung. We also established a highly metastatic
MDA-MB-435s (MDA-MB-435s-HM) cell line from the mouse model. Changes in protein
profiles in different culture conditions were investigated by protein microarray 
analysis. The levels of CXC chemokine ligand 16, interleukin (IL)-2Rα, IL-2Rγ,
matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-1, MMP-9, platelet-derived growth factor receptor 
(PDGFR)-α, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1α, transforming growth factor
(TGF)-β, platelet endothelial cell adhesion molecule (PECAM)-1 and vascular
endothelial (VE)-cadherin were significantly greater (> fivefold) in the culture 
medium from MDA-MB-435s-HM cells than in that from MDA-MB-435s cells. Moreover,
the levels of MMP-9, PDGFR-α, and PECAM-1 were significantly greater in the
co-culture medium of MDA-MB-435s-HM cells and CD133+ HPCs than in that from
MDA-MB-435s-HM cells. Differentially expressed proteins were validated by
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and expression of their transcripts was
confirmed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Moreover,
inhibition of MMP-9, PDGFR-α, and PECAM-1 by their specific inhibitors or
antibodies significantly decreased cell migration, delayed lung metastasis, and
decreased recruitment of VEGFR1+CD133+ HPCs into lung. Intra-hepatic growth of
HPCs enhanced the invasive growth of MDA-MB-435s-HM cells in the liver. Our data 
indicate that VEGFR1+CD133+ HPCs contribute to lung metastasis.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) serve an important role in renal cancer, but renal cancer
miRNA expression data remains inconsistent. Therefore, there is a requirement for
integrated analysis of these data. An increasing number of studies demonstrate
that miR‑122 is dysregulated in numerous cancer types, including liver, lung and 
breast cancer, yet its role in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) remains
unclear. In the present study, an integrated analysis of four ccRCC miRNAs
expression datasets was performed and the expression of miR‑122 in the present
cohort was validated. The effects of cell proliferation, colony formation,
migration and invasion of ccRCC cells in vitro were assayed following
transfection with miR‑122 mimics and inhibitor. The target gene of miR‑122 was
confirmed using a luciferase reporter assay, and a xenograft mouse model was used
to determine the effect of miR‑122 in ccRCC tumorigenicity in vivo. The present
results demonstrated that patients with ccRCC with an increased miR‑122 level in 
tumor tissues had a shortened metastasis‑free survival time as indicated by The
Cancer Genome Atlas‑Kidney Renal Clear Cell Carcinoma dataset and the present
ccRCC cohort. Overexpression of miR‑122 in 786‑O cells improved cell
proliferation, colony formation, migration and invasion, while knockdown of
miR‑122 in SN12‑PM6 cells inhibited cell growth, colony formation, migration and 
invasion. Western blot analysis and luciferase reporter assays were used to
identify FOXO3 as a direct target of miR‑122. The present results indicate that
miR‑122 serves a tumor‑promoting role by direct targeting FOXO3 in ccRCC.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with lung cancer often have comorbidities that may
increase risk of symptomatic adverse events (AEs) and physical function decline. 
The objective of this study was to examine age-related differences in
patient-reported symptoms and functional domains in patients with advanced lung
cancer receiving immunotherapy drugs.
METHODS: Three randomized controlled trials of anti-programmed death
receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy in patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer that included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were identified. 
Baseline PRO data were pooled for treatment arms from 2 trials that included the 
same PRO tools. Age-related differences in baseline mean scores for each of the
health-related quality of life functional and symptom scales were assessed for
patients ≥70 years and <70 years. Mean change from Baseline at 3 months was also 
calculated and plotted for each age group. The adequacy of PRO assessments was
assessed by comparing clinician-reported AE data in the 3 trials to the item
content of the PRO tools included.
RESULTS: Across the 3 trials, 75 of patients were under 70 and 26% patients were 
70 and older. Comparing baseline scores in the 2 trials with the same PRO tool,
older adults reported small differences including lower physical functioning,
less pain, insomnia and financial difficulties, and higher social functioning
than younger patients at baseline. No large differences in the distributions of
mean change from baseline in function or symptom were identified. Several common 
clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were not assessed by the PRO strategy employed
in the 3 trials. Three clinician-reported symptomatic AEs (rash, fever, and
pruritus) that were commonly reported in the safety data (9%-19%) were not
assessed using the PRO tools employed.
CONCLUSION: While several small differences were seen, there did not appear to be
large differences at baseline or in the distributions of change from baseline in 
PRO functional domains between younger and older patients with lung cancer
undergoing anti-programmed death receptor -1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy.
Relevant symptomatic side effects were not assessed by PRO measures in these
trials, and this is a limitation of current PRO assessment strategies.

CME: Paraneoplastic Endocrine Syndromes Abstract. Paraneoplastic endocrine
syndromes are caused by ectopic hormone production by malignant tumor cells.
Knowledge of paraneoplastic endocrine syndromes may allow a timely diagnosis of
the underlying cancer at a treatable stage and, on the other hand, appropriate
treatment of the endocrine manifestations reduces morbidity and mortality of the 
affected patients. The most common endocrine syndromes are paraneoplastic
hypercalcaemia, caused by the secretion of PTHrP, and hyponatremia, caused by the
inadequate secretion of ADH. Although there may be clinical symptoms like
fatigue, nausea/vomiting and renal insufficiency for hypercalcaemia and gait
disturbances and mental alterations for hyponatremia, the diagnosis must be
confirmed by laboratory testing and prompt the search for associated tumors.

die gezielte endokrine Therapie reduziert Morbidität und Mortalität der
betroffenen Patienten. Die häufigsten endokrinen Paraneoplasien sind die
Hyperkalzämie, humoral bedingt durch die Sekretion von PTHrP durch Tumorzellen
(vor allem solide Tumoren wie Bronchus- und Mammakarzinom), und die
Hyponatriämie, verursacht durch eine inadäquate ADH-Sekretion (typischerweise
durch das kleinzellige Bronchuskarzinom). Beide Tumorsyndrome können sich
klinisch manifestieren und müssen differenzialdiagnostisch beim laborchemischen
Befund einer Hyperkalzämie bzw. einer Hyponatriämie in Betracht gezogen und je
nach Ausmass therapiert werden.

In the era of precision medicine immunohistochemistry (IHC) and
immunocytochemistry (ICC) share some of the highlights in personalized treatment.
Survival data obtained from clinical trials shape the cut-offs and IHC scoring
that serve as recommendations for patient selection both for targeted and
conventional therapies. Assessment of Estrogen and Progesterone Receptors along
with HER2 status has been among the first approved immunostaining assays
revolutionizing breast cancer treatment. Similarly, ALK positivity predicts the
efficacy of ALK inhibitors in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
In recent years, Programmed Death Ligand 1 (PD-L1) IHC assays have been approved 
as companion or complimentary diagnostic tools predicting the response to
checkpoint inhibitors. Anti-PD-L1 and anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies have
inaugurated a new period in the treatment of advanced cancers, but the path to
approval of these biomarkers is filled with immunohistochemical challenges. The
latter brings to the fore the significance of molecular pathology as a hub
between basic and clinical research. Besides, novel markers are translated into
routine practice, suggesting that we are at the beginning of a new exciting
period. Unraveling the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular homeostasis
unfolds biomarkers with greater specificity and sensitivity. The introduction of 
GL13 (SenTraGor®) for the detection of senescent cells in archival material, the 
implementation of key players of stress response pathways and the development of 
compounds detecting common mutant P53 isoforms in dictating oncological
treatments are paradigms for precision oncology.

BACKGROUND The aim of this paper was to investigate the association between
clinicopathological factors and the coagulation test in lung cancer patients
during follow-up care after treatment. MATERIAL AND METHODS Ninety-five medical
patients with histologically proven advanced lung carcinoma (LC) who had
undergone radiotherapy were prospectively reviewed between January 2014 and
December 2016. The study investigated the relationship between the biochemical
results, the disease stage, and the survival rate in lung cancer patients.
Post-treatment coagulation-based D-dimer (DD), fibrinogen (Fib), and complete
blood count (CBC) were evaluated during the follow-up over a period of 2 years
after treatment or until the patient's death. RESULTS An increase of D-dimer
generates an increased chance of early death by approximately 0.03% per 1 D-dimer
unit. In cases when the difference in the D-dimer concentration equals 1000, the 
risk of an early death increases by (1.00031000-1)×100%=35%. CONCLUSIONS High
levels of D-dimer are associated with an advanced form of disease with metastasis
and higher risk of early death in lung cancer patients.

KIAA1199 is often upregulated in cancer cells, including non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Although KIAA1199 is associated with aggressive tumor phenotype
and poor survival in NSCLC, little is known about its functional role in NSCLC
progression. Using archived clinical samples, we evaluated KIAA1199 messenger RNA
(mRNA) and protein expression in NSCLC tissues and correlated with NSCLC
clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival. Using NSCLC cell
lines, KIAA1199 was either silenced using gene-specific shRNA or overexpressed to
assess the impact on EMT signaling pathways. Finally, in a mouse xenograft NSCLC 
model, we determine the therapeutic potential of KIAA1199 repression. Our data
showed that KIAA1199 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to
adjacent normal tissues both at the mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein levels
(P < 0.05). KIAA1199 overexpression is an independent prognostic marker for
overall survival (HR = 1.833). In NSCLC cell lines, KIAA1199 expression directly 
influences the expression of EMT markers, EMT-inducing transcription factors
(EMT-TFs), and EMT signaling molecules. Knocking down of KIAA1199 expression in
the mouse NSCLC xenograft model significantly suppressed tumor growth and
augmented the efficacy of chemotherapy (n = 5; P < 0.05). We conclude that
KIAA1199 is not only a prognostic marker but a novel therapeutic target in NSCLC 
through regulating EMT signaling pathway. KEY MESSAGES: KIAA1199 overexpression
is an independent prognostic marker in NSCLC. KIAA1199 expression directly
influences the expression of EMT markers. KIAA1199 promotes invasion and
migration in NSCLC via PI3K-Akt mediated EMT.

Bone is the most common metastatic site for breast cancer.
Estrogen-related-receptor alpha (ERRα) has been implicated in cancer cell
invasiveness. Here, we established that ERRα promotes spontaneous metastatic
dissemination of breast cancer cells from primary mammary tumors to the skeleton.
We carried out cohort studies, pharmacological inhibition, gain-of-function
analyses in vivo and cellular and molecular studies in vitro to identify new
biomarkers in breast cancer metastases. Meta-analysis of human primary breast
tumors revealed that high ERRα expression levels were associated with bone but
not lung metastases. ERRα expression was also detected in circulating tumor cells
from metastatic breast cancer patients. ERRα overexpression in murine 4T1 breast 
cancer cells promoted spontaneous bone micro-metastases formation when tumor
cells were inoculated orthotopically, whereas lung metastases occurred
irrespective of ERRα expression level. In vivo, Rank was identified as a target
for ERRα. That was confirmed in vitro in Rankl stimulated tumor cell invasion, in
mTOR/pS6K phosphorylation, by transactivation assay, ChIP and bioinformatics
analyses. Moreover, pharmacological inhibition of ERRα reduced primary tumor
growth, bone micro-metastases formation and Rank expression in vitro and in vivo.
Transcriptomic studies and meta-analysis confirmed a positive association between
metastases and ERRα/RANK in breast cancer patients and also revealed a positive
correlation between ERRα and BRCA1mut carriers. Taken together, our results
reveal a novel ERRα/RANK axis by which ERRα in primary breast cancer promotes
early dissemination of cancer cells to bone. These findings suggest that ERRα may
be a useful therapeutic target to prevent bone metastases.

Lighting technology is rapidly advancing toward shorter wavelength illuminations 
that offer energy-efficient properties. Along with this advantage, the increased 
use of such illuminations also poses some health challenges, particularly breast 
cancer progression. Here, we evaluated the effects of artificial light at night
(ALAN) of 4 different spectral compositions (500-595 nm) at 350 Lux on melatonin 
suppression by measuring its urine metabolite 6-sulfatoxymelatonin, global DNA
methylation, tumor growth, metastases formation, and urinary corticosterone
levels in 4T1 breast cancer cell-inoculated female BALB/c mice. The results
revealed an inverse dose-dependent relationship between wavelength and melatonin 
suppression. Short wavelength increased tumor growth, promoted lung metastases
formation, and advanced DNA hypomethylation, while long wavelength lessened these
effects. Melatonin treatment counteracted these effects and resulted in reduced
cancer burden. The wavelength suppression threshold for melatonin-induced tumor
growth was 500 nm. These results suggest that short wavelength increases cancer
burden by inducing aberrant DNA methylation mediated by the suppression of
melatonin. Additionally, melatonin suppression and global DNA methylation are
suggested as promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and therapy of breast
cancer. Finally, ALAN may manifest other physiological responses such as stress
responses that may challenge the survival fitness of the animal under natural
environments.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Tumor-infiltrating fibroblasts are a heterogeneous population,
and different subpopulations play differential roles in tumor microenvironment.
However, the prognostic role of podoplanin+ fibroblasts in human solid tumors
still remains controversial. Therefore, we performed the meta-analysis to better 
understand the role of this subpopulation in prognosis prediction for patients
with solid tumor.
METHODS: We searched PubMed and EBSCO to identify the studies evaluating the
association of intratumoral podoplanin+ fibroblast density detected by
immunohistochemical method and overall survival (OS) and/or disease-free survival
(DFS) in patients with solid tumor, then computed extracted data into hazard
ratios for OS, DFS and clinicopathological features with STATA 12.0.
RESULTS: A total of 4883 patients from 29 published studies were incorporated
into this meta-analysis. We found that podoplanin+ fibroblast infiltration
significantly decreased OS and DFS in all types of solid tumors. In stratified
analyses, podoplanin+ fibroblast infiltration was significantly associated with
worse OS in cholangiocarcinoma, breast, lung and pancreatic cancer. And these
cells were inversely associated with DFS in breast, lung and pancreatic cancer.
In addition, high density of these cells significantly correlated with
unfavorable clinicopathological features such as lymph node metastasis, TNM
stage, lymphatic and vascular invasion of solid tumor.
CONCLUSION: Podoplanin+ fibroblast infiltration leads to worse clinical outcome
in solid tumors, implicating that it is a valuable prognostic biomarker and
targeting it may have a potential for effective treatment.

OBJECTIVE: Osteosarcoma is the most common primary malignant skeleton tumor that 
derives from mesenchymal cells. Emerging evidences have identified the vital role
of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in the development of osteosarcoma. In this
study, we aimed to investigate the role of lncRNA gastric carcinoma highly
expressed transcript 1 (GHET1) in osteosarcoma progression.
METHODS: The expression levels of relevant genes in clinical samples and cell
lines were determined by quantitative real-time PCR. Cell proliferation was
determined by CCK8 and cell colony formation assays. Transwell assay was used to 
detect the invasion and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Cell apoptosis and cell 
cycle were detected by flow cytometry. Protein levels were detected by western
blot. In vivo tumor growth was investigated in the xenograft nude mice model. To 
determine whether growth inhibition and apoptosis are responsible for antitumor
activity of silencing GHET1, immunohistochemistry for proliferation and TUNEL
assay was performed in xenograft tissues. In vivo lung metastasis was performed
to detect the effect of GHET1 on cell metastasis ability.
RESULTS: Our results revealed that GHET1 was up-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues
compared to normal tissues. GHET1 was also increased in osteosarcoma cell lines
compared to normal osteoplastic cell line. The up-regulation of GHET1 was
significantly associated with TNM stage, distant metastasis and lymph node
metastasis in patients with osteosarcoma. In vitro studies showed that silencing 
GHET1 in MG-63 and U2OS cells inhibited cell proliferation, cell invasion and
migration and epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), promoted cell apoptotic
rate, and also caused an increase in cell population at G0/G1 phase with a
decrease in cell population at S phase. Overexpression of GHET1 promoted the
proliferation, invasion and migration of osteosarcoma cells. Importantly,
silencing GHET1 inhibited tumor growth and tumor metastasis in mice
MG-63-xenograft model in association with changes of EMT-related genes, reduced
expression of Ki-67 and promotion of apoptosis.
CONCLUSION: GHET1 was up-regulated in osteosarcoma tissues and cell lines,
inhibited cell apoptosis, promoted cell proliferation, invasion and migration by 
affecting EMT in vitro, and was correlated with the tumor growth and metastasis
in vivo. GHET1 may be a potential therapeutic target of osteosarcoma treatment.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of microRNA-129 on the migration and invasion 
in (Non small cell lung cancer) NSCLC cells and involved mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 cells were cultured and transfected with microRNA-129
(miR-129) mimic. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were used to analyses
the migration and invasion of A549 cells, respectively. The SOX4 expression
changes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay
was used to determine the binding site between miR-129 and the 3'-UTR of SOX4.
A549 cells, miR-129 up-regulated A549 cells and miR-129 + SOX4 up-regulated A549 
cells were treated with TGF-β in order to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The miR-129 and SOX4 after TGF-β treatment were measured. The
EMT markers level changes were detected by western blot.
RESULTS: Up-regulation of miR-129 significantly inhibited the migration and
invasion of A549 cells. miR-129 mimic transfection could reduce the mRNA and
protein level of SOX4. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-129 could
bind to the 3'-UTR of SOX4. TGF-β induced EMT accompanied by the reduction of
miR-129 and elevating of SOX4. Up-regulation of miR-129 could reverse the EMT
marker changes caused by TGF-β, however, the SOX4 overexpression antagonized this
effect of miR-129.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-129 could suppress the migration and invasion of A549 cells. The
potential mechanism may be that miR-129 inhibit EMT via targeting SOX4.

The discovery and identification of reliable disease biomarkers and relevant
disrupted metabolic pathways is still a major challenge in metabolomics. Here, we
proposed a biotransformation-based metabolomics profiling method to identify
reliable disease biomarkers by simultaneous quantitation and qualification of
cancer-related metabolites and their metabolic pathways via liquid
chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). The approach was based on
selecting a subset of known cancer-related metabolites from our previous
metabolomics work, cancer research literature and biological significance. The
metabolic profiling of pathway-related metabolites was developed by predicted
multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) of ion pairs based on their chemical
structures and biotransformation. Then, a high-throughput quantitative method was
established. Overall, this approach enables the sensitive and accurate detection 
of cancer-related metabolites and the identification of other relevant
metabolites, which facilitates better data quality and in-depth investigation of 
dysregulated metabolic pathways. As a proof of concept, the approach was applied 
to a small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) study. The results showed that 43 metabolites 
were significantly changed, and arginine metabolism was apparently disturbed,
which proved the proposed approach could be a powerful tool for discovering
reliable disease biomarkers and aberrant metabolic pathways.

INTRODUCTION: Prognostic biomarkers have been very elusive in the lung squamous
cell carcinoma (SCC) and none is currently being used in the clinical setting. We
aimed to identify and validate the clinical utility of a protein-based prognostic
signature to stratify patients with early lung SCC according to their risk of
recurrence or death.
METHODS: Patients were staged following the new International Association for the
Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC) staging criteria (eighth edition, 2018). Three
independent retrospective cohorts of 117, 96 and 105 patients with lung SCC were 
analysed to develop and validate a prognostic signature based on
immunohistochemistry for five proteins.
RESULTS: We identified a five protein-based signature whose prognostic index (PI)
was an independent and significant predictor of disease-free survival (DFS)
(p<0.001; HR=4.06, 95% CI 2.18 to 7.56) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.004;
HR=2.38, 95% CI 1.32 to 4.31). The prognostic capability of PI was confirmed in
an external multi-institutional cohort for DFS (p=0.042; HR=2.01, 95% CI 1.03 to 
3.94) and for OS (p=0.031; HR=2.29, 95% CI 1.08 to 4.86). Moreover, PI added
complementary information to the newly established IASLC TNM 8th edition staging 
system. A combined prognostic model including both molecular and anatomical (TNM)
criteria improved the risk stratification in both cohorts (p<0.05).
CONCLUSION: We have identified and validated a clinically feasible protein-based 
prognostic model that complements the updated TNM system allowing more accurate
risk stratification. This signature may be used as an advantageous tool to
improve the clinical management of the patients, allowing the reduction of lung
SCC mortality through a more accurate knowledge of the patient's potential
outcome.

INTRODUCTION: The phase II JO28638 study evaluated first-line onartuzumab plus
erlotinib in patients with MET-positive advanced, metastatic, or post-operative
recurrent non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutations. The study was stopped following termination of the
global METLung study (OAM4971g), which showed lack of efficacy in the
onartuzumab/erlotinib arm. We present immature efficacy and safety data from
JO28638.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naïve patients aged ≥ 20 years were enrolled.
Patients received onartuzumab (15 mg/kg every 3 weeks) plus erlotinib (150 mg
once daily) until progression or unacceptable toxicity. The co-primary endpoints 
were investigator (INV)-assessed progression-free survival (PFS) and safety.
Secondary endpoints: overall response rate (ORR), disease control rate (DCR),
overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and pharmacokinetics.
Exploratory biomarker analyses were also conducted.
RESULTS: 61 patients received treatment. Median age was 67 years and most
patients had stage IV NSCLC (71%), MET-IHC score 2 (87%), and exon 19 deletion
EGFR mutation (53%). Median PFS (INV) was 8.5 months (95% confidence interval
[CI] 6.8-12.4); median OS was 15.6 months (95% CI 15.6-not evaluable); ORR was
68.9% (95% CI 55.7-80.1); median DOR was not reached; DCR was 88.5% (95% CI
77.8-95.3). Pharmacokinetics were similar to previous studies. All patients
experienced an adverse event (AE); 26 patients discontinued treatment due to AEs;
no grade 5 AEs were reported. No significant correlation was found between
biomarkers and efficacy outcomes.
CONCLUSION: The results presented are inconclusive due to the early termination
of the study.

INTRODUCTION: Partner and localizer of BRCA2 (PALB2) is essential for homologous 
recombination repair. We examined mRNA levels of DNA repair genes, including
partner and localizer of BRCA2 gene (PALB2), ring finger protein 8 gene (RNF8),
replication timing regulatory factor 1 gene (RIF1), ATM serine/threonine kinase
gene (ATM), and tumor protein p53 binding protein 1 gene (53BP1) as predictive
biomarkers for cisplatin-docetaxel in the European phase III BRCA1, DNA repair
associated (BRCA1)-receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80) expression
customization (BREC) phase III clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier
NCT00617656).
METHODS: The study was a prespecified secondary objective of the BREC trial. We
assessed mRNA levels of PALB2 and four more DNA repair genes (RNF8, RIF1, ATM and
53BP1) as biomarkers in tissue from 177 patients with cisplatin-docetaxel-treated
NSCLC. We examined the relationship of gene expression levels with
progression-free survival, overall survival, and response.
RESULTS: In 177 patients with NSCLC (who had a median age of 62 years and
included 140 men and 91 patients with adenocarcinoma), only high PALB2 mRNA
expression was predictive in the progression-free survival Cox regression
analysis (hazard ratio = 0.63, 95% confidence interval: 0.42-0.83, p = 0.0080).
PALB2 was also predictive of overall survival (hazard ratio = 0.68, 95%
confidence interval: 0.42-0.90, p = 0.0266). Among the 158 patients evaluable for
response, high PALB2 mRNA expression was predictive of response to
cisplatin-docetaxel. Specifically, an objective response rate of 77% to
cisplatin-docetaxel was observed for patients with high PALB2 mRNA expression
compared with a rate of only 23 % for those with low PALB2 mRNA expression (p =
0.0448).
CONCLUSIONS: High PALB2 mRNA expression identified patients with NSCLC who
significantly benefited from cisplatin-docetaxel chemotherapy in the European
BREC phase III clinical trial. The combination of chemotherapy with immunotherapy
will become the standard of care, and a predictive marker of response to
chemotherapy may accurately guide therapeutic decision making.

BACKGROUND: The spectrum of lung neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) encompasses low
grade typical carcinoid (TC), intermediate grade atypical carcionid (AC) and high
grade, both large cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC) and small cell lung
cancer (SCLC), with extreme differences in management and survival.
OBJECTIVE: To study clinicopathologic and prognostic factors affecting survival
of lung NETs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This is a retrospective study evaluating 35 patients with
primary lung NETs treated at National Cancer Institute of Egypt (NCI-E) between
January 2010 and December 2014. Pathological diagnosis depended on definite
morphology and positivity to at least one of the neuroendocrine markers by
immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: The mean age of the patients was 53 ± 11.2 years with male predominance.
Performance status (PS) I was encountered in 48.6%. SCLC was the prevalent
histology in 68.6%, followed by LCNEC & TC in 20 & 11.4%, respectively. Curative 
surgery was employed in 100 & 57% of TC & LCNEC patients, respectively. Stage IV 
was anticipated in 87.5 & 43% of SCLC & LCNEC, respectively. For the entire
cohort, the median event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) were 8.0
and 13.7 months, respectively, whereas the 3-year EFS and OS were 17.8 & 20%,
respectively. SCLC patients showed significantly the worst OS compared to other
NETs (p = 0.001). Patients who presented with stage IV and PS > I demonstrated
significantly shorter OS than those with locoregional and PS I (p = 0.00001
&p = 0.002, respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: SCLC subtype, stage IV and initial PS > I are poor prognostic
factors for lung NETs associated with shorter survival. This conclusion needs to 
be confirmed by larger studies.

BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have demonstrated
improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a subset of
patients with metastatic or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
To date, no blood biomarkers have been identified in NSCLC to predict clinical
outcomes of treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies.
PATIENT AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of retrospectively registered data 
of 157 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies at Mayo
Clinic in Florida and Rochester. White blood cell count, absolute neutrophil
count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), ANC to ALC (ANC: ALC) ratio,
absolute eosinophil count, absolute monocyte count (AMC), platelet counts, and
myeloid to lymphoid (M:L) ratio at baseline and throughout treatment were
assessed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were performed.
RESULTS: We treated 146 patients with nivolumab and 11 with pembrolizumab between
January 1, 2015 and April 15, 2017. At median follow-up of 20 months, median OS
and PFS were 6.0 and 2.6 months, respectively. Higher baseline ANC, AMC, ANC: ALC
ratio and M: L ratio correlated with worse clinical outcomes in patients who
underwent anti-PD-1 treatment. A baseline ANC: ALC ratio of 5.9 or higher had a
significantly increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] =1.94; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.24-3.03; P = 0.004) and disease progression (HR, 1.65; 95% CI,
1.17-2.34; P = 0.005) compared with patients with lower ratio. Similarly, a
baseline M: L ratio of 11.3 or higher had significantly increased risk of death
(HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.54-4.05; P < 0.001), even after a multivariate analysis (HR, 
2.31; P = 0.002), compared to those with lower ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased baseline ANC: ALC ratio and M: L ratio before initiation
of anti-PD1 antibodies were associated with poor PFS and OS in advanced NSCLC
patients. The potential predictive value of these readily available biomarkers
might help with risk stratification and treatment strategies. These findings
warrant further investigation in a larger, prospective study.

OBJECTIVE: Lung cancer is one of the deadliest cancers responsible for
significant mortality and morbidity across the globe. The unavailability of
efficient treatments, lack of reliable biomarkers and potent therapeutic targets,
limit the treatment of lung cancer. In this study, we explored the potential of
long non-coding RNA (lncRNA) urothelial carcinoma-associated 1 (UCA1) as the
therapeutic target for lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression analysis was carried out by quantitative
Real Time-Polymerase Chain Reaction (qRT-PCR). Cell viability was monitored by
cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8) assay. The 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI),
annexin-V/Propidium iodide staining and comet assays were used to detect
apoptosis. Boyden chamber and wound heal assays were used for cell to asses cell 
invasion and migration respectively. Protein expression was determined by
immunoblotting.
RESULTS: The expression of lncRNA UCA1 was determined by qRT-PCR in six different
types of lung cancer cell lines. It was observed that lncRNA UCA1 was
significantly (p < 0.05) upregulated in all the lung cancer cell lines. To
investigate the role of lncRNA UCA1 in lung cancer, its expression was suppressed
by transfection of the lung cancer NCI-H23 cells by si-UCA1. The results showed
that suppression of lncRNA UCA1 significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the viability of
NCI-H23 cancer cells via induction of the apoptosis. Furthermore, the lncRNA UCA1
suppression (p < 0.05) significantly inhibited the migration and invasion of the 
NCI-H23 lung cancer at least in part via inhibition of mitogen-activated protein 
kinase 1 (MAPK1). Additionally, the suppression of MAPK1 exhibited similar
effects on the proliferation, migration, and invasion of the NCI-H23 cells as
that of UCA1 silencing. Finally, the co-suppression of lncRNA UCA1 and MAPK1
exhibited synergistic effects on cell proliferation, migration, and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated that lncRNA UCA1 could be an important therapeutic
target for curbing lung cancer.

The matched case-control design is frequently used in the study of complex
disorders and can result in significant gains in efficiency, especially in the
context of measuring biomarkers; however, risk prediction in this setting is not 
straightforward. We propose an inverse-probability weighting approach to estimate
the predictive ability associated with a set of covariates. In particular, we
propose an algorithm for estimating the summary index, area under the curve
corresponding to the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve associated with a
set of pre-defined covariates for predicting a binary outcome. By combining data 
from the parent cohort with that generated in a matched case control study, we
describe methods for estimation of the population parameters of interest and the 
corresponding area under the curve. We evaluate the bias associated with the
proposed methods in simulations by considering a range of parameter settings. We 
illustrate the methods in two data applications: (1) a prospective cohort study
of cardiovascular disease in women, the Women's Health Study, and (2) a matched
case-control study nested within the Nurses' Health Study aimed at risk
prediction of invasive breast cancer.

PURPOSE: Elastin is a signature protein of lungs. Increased elastin turnover
driven by altered proteolytic activity is an important part of lung
tumorigenesis. Elastin-derived fragments have been shown to be pro-tumorigenic,
however, little is known regarding the biomarker potential of such elastin
fragments. Here, we present an elastin turnover profile by non-invasively
quantifying five specific elastin degradation fragments generated by different
proteases.
METHODS: Elastin fragments were assessed in serum from patients with stage I-IV
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (n = 40) and healthy controls (n = 30) using
competitive ELISAs targeting different protease-generated fragments of elastin:
ELM12 (generated by matrix metalloproteinase MMP-9 and -12), ELM7 (MMP-7), EL-NE 
(neutrophil elastase), EL-CG (cathepsin G) and ELP-3 (proteinase 3).
RESULTS: ELM12, ELM7, EL-NE and EL-CG were all significantly elevated in NSCLC
patients (n = 40) when compared to healthy controls (n = 30) (ELM12, p = 0.0191; 
ELM7, p < 0.0001; EL-NE, p < 0.0001; EL-CG, p < 0.0001). ELP-3 showed no
significant difference between patients and controls (p = 0.8735). All fragments 
correlated positively (Spearman, r: 0.69-0.81) when compared pairwise, except
ELM12 (Spearman, r: 0.042-0.097). In general, all fragments were detectable
across all stages of the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: Elastin fragments generated by different proteases are elevated in
lung cancer patients compared to healthy controls but differ in their presence.
This demonstrates non-invasive biomarker potential of elastin fragments in serum 
from lung cancer patients and suggests that different pathological mechanisms may
be responsible for the elastin turnover, warranting further validation in
clinical trials.

BACKGROUND: Alpinia nantoensis (Zingiberaceae) is an aromatic plant endemic to
Taiwan, which is used as food flavoring and traditional herbal medicine. The
biological activities of compounds isolated from this plant are rarely
investigated.
PURPOSE: The present study was aimed to investigate the anti-metastatic potential
of trans-3‑methoxy‑5-hydroxystilbene (MHS) a major stilbene isolated from the
rhizomes of A. nantonensis.
METHODS: We investigated the anti-metastatic potential of MHS on human non-small 
cell lung carcinoma (A549) cell line using wound healing, trans-well, western
blot, zymography and immunofluorescence assays.
RESULTS: Initial cytotoxicity assay showed that treatment with MHS did not
exhibit cytotoxicity to A549 cells up to the concentration of 40 µM. Further in
vitro wound healing and transwell chamber assays revealed that MHS significantly 
inhibited tumor cell migration in a dose-dependent manner, which is associated
with inhibition of matrix mettalloprotinase-2 (MMP-2) and matrix
mettalloprotinase-9 (MMP-9) at both enzyme and protein levels. The inhibition of 
MMPs activity by MHS was reasoned by suppression of their corresponding
transcription factor, β-catenin as indicated by reduced levels of β-catenin in
the nucleus. MHS also regulates epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) by
increasing E-cadherin and occludin as well as decreasing N-cadherin levels in
A549 cells. Furthermore, pre-treatment with MHS significantly inhibited A549
cells migration and EMT in TGF-β induced A549 cells.
CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating 
that MHS, a plant-derived stilbene has a promising ability to inhibit lung cancer
cell metastasis in vitro.

Tumor associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) is a membrane-bound glycoprotein
complex that is overexpressed in many adenocarcinomas. Recently, monoclonal
antibody targeting TAG72, minretumomab, have been introduced as a potential
therapeutic target in colorectal cancers (CRC) as well as breast and lung
cancers. However, the detailed expression profile of TAG72 and its prognostic
effect in CRC are not clear yet. We investigated the relationship between tumor
associated glycoprotein 72 (TAG-72) expression and clinicopathologic
characteristics in CRC using 3E8 antibody, a fully humanized antibody with the
highest affinity to TAG-72. Immunohistochemical staining for TAG-72 was performed
in 578 CRC patients, and the results were analyzed using a modified Remmele
scoring system (score: 0-12). Of the 578 patients, 144 (24.9%) composed the
TAG-72 overexpression (TAG-72high) group. TAG-72high was significantly associated
with microsatellite stable tumor (P = .002), lymphatic invasion (P = .001),
venous invasion (P = .005), and high pN status (P < .001). In survival analyses, 
TAG-72high group showed shorter disease-free survival in univariate analysis
(P = .001), and TAG-72high was found to be an independent prognostic factor in
multivariate analysis (P = .028), in addition to TNM stage. In conclusion, TAG-72
is thought to be the factors involved in the progression of CRC and may be
considered as one of the potential therapeutic target.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Serum apolipoprotein A1 (apoA1) has been reported to be
abnormally expressed in several malignancies. However, the prognostic role of
apoA1 in solid tumors is still controversial. We conducted this meta-analysis to 
obtain a more accurate evaluation of prognostic significance of apoA1 in Chinese 
patients with solid tumors.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of electronic databases was carried
out up to August 2018. We included studies investigating the association between 
pretreatment serum apoA1 level and clinicopathological features, including
survival outcomes, in solid tumors. Hazard ratios (HRs) and odds ratio (ORs) with
95% confidence intervals (CIs) were applied as effect size estimates.
RESULTS: A total of 13 studies and 8052 patients were included in our
meta-analysis. Elevated level of pretreatment serum apoA1 was markedly associated
with an improved OS (pooled HR = 0.608, 95% CI = 0.557 - 0.665, P < 0.001). The
statistical significances were observed in all cancer types, including digestive 
system malignancies (pooled HR = 0.633; 95% CI = 0.550-0.727; P < 0.001), urinary
system cancers (pooled HR = 0.471; 95% CI = 0.352-0.630; P < 0.001),
nasopharyngeal cancer (pooled HR = 0.642; 95% CI = 0.538-0.766; P < 0.001) and
non-small cell lung cancer (pooled HR = 0.526; 95% CI = 0.329-0.841; P = 0.007), 
but not in breast cancer (pooled HR = 0.573; 95% CI = 0.266-1.246; P = 0.155).
Meanwhile, cancer patients with a low level of serum apoA1 suffered an
unfavorable DFS (pooled HR = 0.714, 95% CI = 0.603 - 0.845, P < 0.001). Moreover,
abnormal serum apoA1 was significantly correlated to tumor size (pooled OR =
0.640, 95% CI = 0.475 - 0.863, P = 0.003), tumor differentiation (pooled HR =
0.724, 95% CI = 0.565 - 0.929, P = 0.011), and tumor stage (pooled HR = 0.493,
95% CI = 0.384 - 0.633, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Elevated level of pretreatment serum apoA1 was significantly
associated with longer survival in patients with solid tumors. Pretreatment serum
apoA1 could serve as a novel positive factor for malignant patient prognosis in
Chinese population.

The T cell receptor repertoire provides a window to the cellular adaptive immune 
response within a tumor, and has the potential to identify specific and
personalized biomarkers for tracking host responses during cancer therapy,
including immunotherapy. We describe a protocol for amplifying, sequencing, and
analyzing T cell receptors which is economical, robust, sensitive, and versatile.
The key experimental step is the ligation of a single-stranded oligonucleotide to
the 3' end of the T cell receptor cDNA, which allows easy amplification of all
possible rearrangements using only a single set of primers per locus, while
simultaneously introducing a unique molecular identifier to label each starting
cDNA molecule. After sequencing, this molecular identifier can be used to correct
both sequence errors and the effects of differential PCR amplification
efficiency, thus producing a more accurate measure of the true T cell receptor
frequency within the sample. This method has been applied to the analysis of
unfractionated human tumor lysates, subpopulations of tumor-infiltrating
lymphocytes, and peripheral blood samples from patients with a variety of solid
tumors.

Purpose: To report the outcomes of stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) for
stage I non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) according to respiratory motion
management method.
Methods: Patients with stage I NSCLC who received SBRT from 2007 to 2015 were
reviewed. Computed tomography (CT) simulation with four-dimensional CT was
performed for respiratory motion assessment. Tumor motion >1 cm in the
craniocaudal direction was selectively treated with advanced respiratory
management: either respiratory gating to a pre-specified portion of the
respiratory cycle or dynamic tracking of an implanted fiducial marker.
Comparisons were made with internal target volume approach, which treated all
phases of respiratory motion.
Results: Of 297 patients treated with SBRT at our institution, 51 underwent
advanced respiratory management (48 with respiratory gating and three with tumor 
tracking) and 246 underwent all-phase treatment. Groups were similarly balanced
with regard to mean age (P=0.242), tumor size (P=0.315), and histology (P=0.715).
Tumor location in the lower lung lobes, as compared to middle or upper lobes, was
more common in those treated with advanced respiratory management (78.4%)
compared to all-phase treatment (25.6%, P<.0001). There were 17 local recurrences
in the treated lesions. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that there were no
differences with regard to mean time to local failure (91.5 vs 98.8 months,
P=0.56), mean time to any failure (73.2 vs 78.7 months, P=0.73), or median
overall survival (43.3 vs 45.5 months, P=0.56) between patients who underwent
advanced respiratory motion management and all-phase treatment.
Conclusion: SBRT with advanced respiratory management (the majority with
respiratory gating) showed similar efficacy to all-phase treatment approach for
stage I NSCLC.

Purpose: Radiotherapy is a major treatment method for patients with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the presence of radioresistant cancer stem
cells (CSCs) may be associated with disease relapse or a poor outcome after
radiotherapy. Voltage-gated calcium channel α2δ1 subunit (encoded by the gene
CACNA2D1) isoform 5 is a marker of CSCs in hepatocellular carcinoma. This study
aimed to investigate the radiosensitivity of α2δ1-high cells in NSCLC cell lines.
Materials and methods: NSCLC cell lines A549, H1975, H1299, and PC9 were used.
CACNA2D1-knockdown and CACNA2D1-overexpressing cell lines were established by
lentiviral infection. Colony formation assay was performed to determine
radiosensitivity. Sphere formation assay in serum-free medium was performed to
evaluate self-renewal capacity. Proteins associated with DNA damage repair were
analyzed by immunofluorescence or Western blot. The monoclonal antibody of α2δ1
was applied alone or in combination with radiation either in vitro or in vivo to 
determine the anti-tumor effect of the antibody.
Results: α2δ1-high cells showed greater sphere-forming efficiency than α2δ1-low
cells and were relatively resistant to radiation. CACNA2D1 knockdown in A549
cells enhanced radiosensitivity, whereas CACNA2D1 overexpression in PC9 and H1975
cells reduced radiosensitivity, suggesting that α2δ1 imparted radioresistance to 
NSCLC cells. Analysis of proteins involved in DNA damage repair suggested that
α2δ1 enhanced the efficiency of DNA damage repair. The monoclonal antibody of
α2δ1 had a synergistic effect with that of radiation to block the self-renewal of
α2δ1-high cells and enhanced the radiosensitivity of α2δ1-positive cells in
colony formation assays. The combination of the α2δ1 antibody with radiation
repressed A549 xenograft growth in vivo.
Conclusion: α2δ1 enhances radioresistance in cancer stem-like cells in NSCLC. The
α2δ1 monoclonal antibody sensitizes α2δ1-high cells to radiation, suggesting that
the antibody may be used to improve the treatment outcome when combined with
radiation in NSCLC.

Protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 inhibits high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma
progression by targeting IκBα.

Background: High-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) represents most of the
ovarian cancers and accounts for 70%-80 % of related deaths. The overall survival
of HGSOC has not been remarkably improved in the past decades, due to the tumor
dissemination in peritoneal cavity and invasion of adjacent organs. Therefore,
identifying molecular biomarkers is invaluable in helping predicting clinical
outcomes and developing targeted chemotherapies. Although there have been studies
revealing the prognostic significance of protein tyrosine phosphatase L1 (PTPL1) 
in breast cancer and lung cancer, its involvement and functions in HGSOC remains 
to be elucidated.
Methods: We retrospectively enrolled a cohort of HGSOC patients after surgical
resection. And analyzed the mRNA and protein levels of PTPL1 in tissue samples.
Results: We found that PTPL1 presented a lower expression in HGSOC tissues than
in adjacent normal ovarian tissues. Besides, the PTPL1 level was negatively
correlated with tumor stage, implying its potential role as a tumor suppressor.
Univariate and multivariate analyses identified that patients with higher PTPL1
showed a better overall survival compared to those with lower PTPL1 expression.
In addition, cellular experiments confirmed the role of PTPL1 in suppressing
tumor proliferation and invasion. Furthermore, we demonstrated that PTPL1
negatively regulated phosphorylation of tyrosine 42 on IκBα (IκBα-pY42). To our
knowledge, this is the initial finding on PTPL1 targeting IκBα-pY42 site.
Finally, our data indicated that PTPL1 suppressed tumor progression by
dephosphorylating IκBα-pY42, which stabilized IκBα and attenuated nucleus
translocation of NF-κB.
Conclusion: Our study revealed a tumor-suppressing role of PTPL1 in HGSOC by
targeting IκBα.

INTRODUCTION: Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) testing has emerged as an
alternative to tumor tissue analyses for the management of metastatic
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. Analysis of cfDNA is a minimally
invasive procedure that might better reflect tumor heterogeneity and allows
repeated testing over the time. Areas covered: This review article covers the
different applications of cfDNA testing in NSCLC: early diagnosis of the disease;
detection of minimal residual disease in early lung cancer; identification of
predictive and prognostic markers in advanced NSCLC patients; monitoring the
response to therapy; assessment of tumor mutation burden. Expert commentary: The 
use of liquid biopsy is rapidly expanding to different applications. The
combination of different circulating biomarkers (cfDNA, protein, miRNA) might
improve the sensitivity and specificity of this approach in patients with low
tumor burden. cfDNA testing is representing a valid source for molecular
profiling in management of metastatic NSCLC patients and is providing important
knowledge on tumor heterogeneity. Clinical trials are needed in order to transfer
the information deriving from liquid biopsy testing in new therapeutic
strategies.

Medicine, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China.

RATIONALE: Medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is an aggressive subtype of thyroid 
cancer with frequent hematogenous metastasis. While its metastasis is usually
observed in the lung, liver, or bone, it rarely migrates to the breast.
PATIENT CONCERNS: Here we report 2 cases with a complaint of breast lump after
initial treatment of MTC.
DIAGNOSES: In both patients, the MTC characteristics of breast nodules were
confirmed by pathologic analysis of biopsy specimens.
INTERVENTIONS: The genetic mutations within the metastatic breast lesion were
evaluated. Wide local excision was thus performed to 1st case, while no
therapeutic intervention for another patient due to the wide-spread presence of
the disease.
OUTCOMES: No sign of relapse or metastasis was found in 1st case during a
14-month follow-up. For 2nd case, the breast nodule grew to 14 mm within 3 months
before remaining stable for 10 months.
LESSONS: MTC can be a very indolent disease despite its aggressiveness.
Reoperation should be considered for patients with local recurrence or resectable
distant metastasis of MTC. The findings for both cases supported serum calcitonin
as an important marker for the evaluation of disease. Future studies are needed
to advance our understanding of its molecular features and improve strategies for
its diagnosis and treatment.

Recent studies reveal that Seneca Valley Virus (SVV) exploits tumor endothelial
marker 8 (TEM8) for cellular entry, the same surface receptor pirated by
bacterial-derived anthrax toxin. This observation is particularly significant as 
SVV is a known oncolytic virus which selectively infects and kills tumor cells,
particularly those of neuroendocrine origin. TEM8 is a transmembrane glycoprotein
that is preferentially upregulated in some tumor cell and tumor-associated
stromal cell populations. Both TEM8 and SVV have been evaluated for targeting of 
tumors of multiple origins, but the connection between the two was previously
unknown. Here, we review currently understood interactions between TEM8 and SVV, 
anthrax protective antigen (PA), and collagen VI, a native binding partner of
TEM8, with an emphasis on potential therapeutic directions moving forward.

Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) is a tyrosine kinase receptor that is a clinical
target of major interest in cancer. Mutations and rearrangements in ALK trigger
the activation of the encoded receptor and its downstream signaling pathways. ALK
mutations have been identified in both familial and sporadic neuroblastoma cases 
as well as in 30 to 40% of relapses, which makes ALK a bona fide target in
neuroblastoma therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) that target ALK are
currently in clinical use for the treatment of patients with ALK-positive
non-small cell lung cancer. However, monotherapy with the ALK inhibitor
crizotinib has been less encouraging in neuroblastoma patients with ALK
alterations, raising the question of whether combinatorial therapy would be more 
effective. In this study, we established both phosphoproteomic and gene
expression profiles of ALK activity in neuroblastoma cells exposed to first- and 
third-generation ALK TKIs, to identify the underlying molecular mechanisms and
identify relevant biomarkers, signaling networks, and new therapeutic targets.
This analysis has unveiled various important leads for novel combinatorial
treatment strategies for patients with neuroblastoma and an increased
understanding of ALK signaling involved in this disease.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide, and a major
problem affecting its mortality is the late diagnosis of the majority of cases,
where treatment options are limited and overall prognosis is very bad. Currently,
a low-dose computed tomography (LD-CT) screening in the high-risk group is the
only available diagnostic strategy that could reduce mortality due to this
malignancy. However, the LD-CT screening test suffers from a high false positive 
rate. Hence, complementation of LD-CT examination with blood-based biomarkers is 
a rational approach to increase efficacy and reduce the cost of early lung cancer
screening programs. Several molecular signatures that discriminate between
patients with early lung cancer and healthy individuals have been proposed in
recent years, which are based on components of serum/plasma metabolome. However, 
none of these signatures has been validated by independent studies based on
material collected during real lung cancer screening. Therefore, the validation
of the real diagnostic value of these otherwise promising candidates remains a
critical step in this challenging field of cancer diagnostics.

Validated serum biomarkers for patients suffering from non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) brain metastasis are urgently needed for early diagnosis, treatment
monitoring, and prognostic classification in daily clinical practice. Serum S100B
was reported to be a marker of leaky blood-brain barrier (BBB), which was often
caused by brain tumors. This study aimed to investigate the role of S100B in
NSCLC brain metastasis. The results showed that serum S100B correlated
significantly with NSCLC brain metastasis (P < 0.001). When evaluated by the ROC 
curve, at the cutoff point 13.83 pg/ml, the sensitivity and specificity were 94% 
and 93%, respectively (AUC= 0.938, P < 0.001). High level of serum S100B was
significantly correlated with a higher number of brain metastases and
significantly worse prognosis (P <  0.05). In addition, S100B was an independent 
prognostic factor (P <  0.001). In conclusion, serum S100B was a sensitive and
specific marker for early detection of brain metastasis in NSCLC and could be
used as a surveillance tool for prognosis evaluation.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with bone-marrow-derived mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs)
has shown benefits in preclinical models of acute respiratory distress syndrome
(ARDS). Safety has not been established for administration of MSCs in critically 
ill patients with ARDS. We did a phase 2a trial to assess safety after
administration of MSCs to patients with moderate to severe ARDS.
METHODS: We did a prospective, double-blind, multicentre, randomised trial to
assess treatment with one intravenous dose of MSCs compared with placebo. We
recruited ventilated patients with moderate to severe ARDS (ratio of partial
pressure of oxygen to fractional inspired oxygen <27 kPa and positive
end-expiratory pressure [PEEP] ≥8 cm H2O) in five university medical centres in
the USA. Patients were randomly assigned 2:1 to receive either 10 × 106/kg
predicted bodyweight MSCs or placebo, according to a computer-generated schedule 
with a variable block design and stratified by site. We excluded patients younger
than 18 years, those with trauma or moderate to severe liver disease, and those
who had received cancer treatment in the previous 2 years. The primary endpoint
was safety and all analyses were done by intention to treat. We also measured
biomarkers in plasma. MSC viability was tested in a post-hoc analysis. This trial
is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT02097641.
FINDINGS: From March 24, 2014, to Feb 9, 2017 we screened 1038 patients, of whom 
60 were eligible for and received treatment. No patient experienced any of the
predefined MSC-related haemodynamic or respiratory adverse events. One patient in
the MSC group died within 24 h of MSC infusion, but death was judged to be
probably unrelated. 28-day mortality did not differ between the groups (30% in
the MSC group vs 15% in the placebo group, odds ratio 2·4, 95% CI 0·5-15·1). At
baseline, the MSC group had numerically higher mean scores than the placebo group
for Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation III (APACHE III; 104 [SD 31]
vs 89 [33]), minute ventilation (11·1 [3·2] vs 9·6 [2·4] L/min), and PEEP (12·4
[3·7] vs 10·8 [2·6] cm H2O). After adjustment for APACHE III score, the hazard
ratio for mortality at 28 days was 1·43 (95% CI 0·40-5·12, p=0·58). Viability of 
MSCs ranged from 36% to 85%.
INTERPRETATION: One dose of intravenous MSCs was safe in patients with moderate
to severe ARDS. Larger trials are needed to assess efficacy, and the viability of
MSCs must be improved.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with highest
mortality in the world, it is still a difficult problem in clinical field. Its
occurrence and development are closely associated with tumor angiogenesis.
Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is an important angiogenesis factor that has involved in
many researches and it has been confirmed that the expression of Ang-2 is
significantly up-regulated in tissues and blood of NSCLC. Meanwhile, Ang-2 is
related to malignant biological behavior of cancer cells, making it a potential
biological marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC. At present,
researches on Ang-2 how to promote the progression of NSCLC around the world are 
focused on Ang-2 regulating the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC.
This paper summarized and estimated the studies and literature reports of
regulatory mechanisms of Ang-2 in NSCLC, hopefully it could help looking for
targeted drug treatment of Ang-2 in the future. .

Prediction of lung cancer metastasis relies on post-resection assessment of tumor
histology, which is a severe limitation since only a minority of lung cancer
patients are diagnosed with resectable disease. Therefore, characterization of
metastasis-predicting biomarkers in pre-resection small biopsy specimens is
urgently needed. Here we report a biomarker consisting of the phosphorylation of 
the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on serine 249 combined with elevated p39
expression. This biomarker correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
traits in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Immunohistochemistry
staining of NSCLC tumor microarrays showed that strong phospho-Rb S249 staining
positively correlated with tumor grade specifically in the squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) subtype. Strong immunoreactivity for p39 positively correlated
with tumor stage, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases, also in SCC.
Linear regression analyses showed that the combined scoring for phospho-Rb S249, 
p39 and E-cadherin in SCC is even more accurate at predicting tumor staging,
relative to each score individually. We propose that combined
immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC samples for Rb phosphorylation on S249,
p39, and E-cadherin protein expression could aid in the assessment of tumor
staging and metastatic potential when tested in small primary tumor biopsies. The
intense staining for phospho-Rb S249 that we observed in high grade SCC could
also aid in the precise sub-classification of poorly differentiated SCCs.

Tumor-derived exosomes (TEXs) play instrumental roles in tumor growth,
angiogenesis, immune modulation, metastasis, and drug resistance. TEX RNAs are a 
new class of noninvasive biomarkers for cancer. Neither current techniques, such 
as quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and
next-generation sequencing, nor new ones, such as electrochemical or surface
plasmon resonance-based biosensors, are able to selectively capture and separate 
TEXs from normal cell-derived exosomes, making TEX RNAs potentially less
sensitive biomarkers. We developed an immuno-biochip that selectively captures
TEXs using antibodies against tumor-associated proteins and quantifies in situ
TEX RNAs using cationic lipoplexes containing molecular beacons. We used the
immuno-biochip to measure the expression of miR-21 microRNA and TTF-1 mRNA in
EGFR- or PD-L1-bearing exosomes from human sera and achieved absolute sensitivity
and specificity in distinguishing normal controls from non-small cell lung cancer
patients. Our results demonstrated that the effective separation of TEXs from
other exosomes greatly improved the detection sensitivity and specificity.
Compared with the traditional immunomagnetic separation-RNA isolation-qRT-PCR
workflow, the immuno-biochip showed superior lung cancer diagnostic performance, 
consumed less samples (∼30 μL), and shortened assay time from ∼24 to 4 h.

Aim: SSAT-1 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cell growth. Amantadine, a
FDA-approved antiviral drug, is a substrate for SSAT-1. The utility of amantadine
as an agent to demonstrate elevated SSAT-1 activity linked to cancer was
conducted.
Results: High levels of SSAT-1 expression were measured in tumor human cell
lines, and in breast, prostate and lung tumor tissue. An increase in the urinary 
levels of acetylated amantadine in cancer patients was observed.
Conclusion: Increases in SSAT-1 contents in tumor tissue could be of value in
targeting cancers with high SSAT-1 expression for confirmation/quantification.
The high levels of acetylated amantadine could be used as a simple and useful
screening test for the presence of cancer.

BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the tumor microenvironment, including
tumor-associated immune cells (ICs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression, differs between primary and metastatic tumors. This study aimed to
elucidate the differences in PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TCs) and ICs
between lung metastases and corresponding primary tumors.
METHODS: We analyzed paired lesions from 44 patients diagnosed with lung
metastases between 2005 and 2017 at Kyushu University. The percentages of
PD-L1-positive TCs and ICs in lung metastases and the primary tumor were
classified into five categories (0: <1%; 1: 1%-4%; 2: 5%-9%; 3: 10%-49%; and 4:
≥50%). Lesions in which ≥1% of the TCs and ICs were PD-L1-positive were
considered positive.
RESULTS: The primary cancers included rectal (n = 19), colon (n = 10), liver
(n = 10), bile duct (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), gall bladder (n = 1) and breast
(n = 1). Discrepancies in PD-L1 expression on TCs and ICs between lung metastases
and primary lesions were observed in 5 (11.4%, κ = 0.23) and 9 (20.5%, κ = 0.11) 
of the 44 cases, respectively. PD-L1 expression on ICs was higher in lung
metastases than paired primary tumors (p = 0.026), although the percentage of
PD-L1-positive TCs was not significantly different between lung metastases and
primary tumors (p = 0.767).
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in PD-L1 expression on TCs and
ICs between lung metastases and primary tumors. Clinicians should be aware of
these differences in the tumor microenvironment when treating patients with
immunotherapy.

Several cancers, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are able to
escape the immunosurveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); among the
molecules involved, the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) and the programmed 
cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) play a crucial role. These aspects are of great
interest in the current immunotherapeutic era, therefore the current study
analyses the TILs, IDO-1, and PD-L1 interactions and their correlations with
clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in NSCLC. One hundred ninety-three
NSCLC surgical specimens, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded were assessed for
TILs density, TILs localization, IDO-1 (clone 4.16H1), and PD-L1 (clone E1L3N)
immunohistochemical expressions. This data was correlated with
clinicopathological parameters, disease free, and overall survivals. IDO-1 and
PD-L1 high expressions were related to the solid pattern of adenocarcinomas
(respectively p = 0.036 and p = 0.026); high PD-L1 expression was correlated with
squamous histotype (p = 0.048). IDO-1 overexpression correlated with former
smokers (p = 0.041), higher adenocarcinoma stages (p = 0.039), and with both
higher TILs density and PD-L1 expression (respectively p = 0.025 and p = 0.0003).
A better prognosis was associated with TILs intratumoral or mixed localizations
(p = 0.029). TILs localization affects NSCLC prognosis; the higher expression of 
IDO-1 and PD-L1 in poorly differentiated and more aggressive lung
adenocarcinomas, as well as the correlation between high PD-L1 expression and
squamous cell histotype, confirm the more efficient immunoescaping of these NSCLC
subgroups.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand
(TRAIL)-based therapies have been used in many human cancers. However, some
tumors are resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1) is a functional marker for identification of CSCs.
METHODS: In this study, we used the colony formation assay, AnnexinV/ PI double
staining and PI staining to detect proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle in
ALDH1+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with TRAIL treatment. In
addition, we established xenograft mouse models to confirm the anti-tumor roles
of TRAIL in vivo. Finally, gene array and western blot were used to detect the
deeper mechanism of the susceptibility of ALDH1+ NSCLC cells to TRAIL.
RESULTS: We confirmed that TRAIL could inhibit proliferation, and induce
apoptosis and G1 arrest in ALDH1+ NSCLC cells. Correspondingly, TRAIL was
associated with decreased tumor size and the favorable survival rate of ALDH1+
cells established xenograft mouse models. ALDH1 could increase the death
receptors (DR) 4 and DR5 expression in ALDH1+ NSCLC cells via activating MEK/ERK 
signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: ALDH1 protein induced MEK-1 mRNA stability and promoted its
translation via its 3'UTR.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used as an anti-cancer platinum agent but its
therapeutic efficacy is limited by acquired drug resistance. To develop a new
therapeutic strategy that could overcome this resistance, it is important to
characterize CDDP-resistant cancer cells. Here we established human lung cancer
A549 cell-derived low- and high-grade CDDP-resistant sublines, termed ACR4 and
ACR20 cells, by stepwise increasing CDDP concentrations up to 4 and 20 μM,
respectively. ACR4 and ACR20 cells showed 6- and 16-fold higher resistance to
CDDP than A549 cells, respectively. Cell migration, invasion, and sphere
formation were significantly decreased, whereas expression of the stem cell
marker CD44v was increased in order of A549, ACR4, and ACR20 cells. The
expression of the cystine-glutamate transporter xCT, which is encoded by SLC7A11,
was upregulated because of the increased cell surface expression of CD44v in
ACR20 cells. Treatment with the xCT inhibitor salazosulfapyridine and knockdown
of SLC7A11 mRNA by a specific siRNA significantly improved sensitivity to CDDP in
A549, ACR4, and ACR20 cells. Thus, our results suggest that CD44v overexpression 
is not involved in cancer stem cell properties but increases xCT expression,
which leads to the acquisition of CDDP-resistance. This mechanism may contribute 
to the development of a new therapeutic strategy that can overcome resistance.

The SWI/SNF complex is a multimeric chromatin remodeling complex that has vital
roles in regulating gene expression and cancer development. However, to date few 
studies have deeply explored the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation. We applied
multi-omics analysis to explore the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and performed the dCas9-DNMT3a system to
evaluate the role of promoter methylation in SMARCA2 transcriptional regulation. 
We also assessed the tumor suppressing roles of SMARCA2 in lung cancer
development by in vitro experiments. SMARCA2 promoter hypermethylation was
significantly associated with decreased expression of SMARCA2. This result was
further confirmed in the results of our own tissues. In addition, we observed
that the mRNA level decreased by about 3 folds while the CpG island of promoter
is nearly 30% hypermethylated by dCas9-DNMT3a system in H1299 cells. We
identified SMARCA2 as a tumor suppressor gene whose expression was downregulated 
in lung cancers. Its inactivation was significantly associated with the poor
survival of lung cancer patients [hazard ratio, HR = 0.35 (0.27-0.45)]. Besides, 
we found that SMARCA2 was a tumor suppressor and can significantly inhibit lung
cancer cell vitality. We found that promoter hypermethylation contribute to the
inactivation of SMARCA2. We also verified its oncogenetic roles of BRM
inactivation in lung adenocarcinoma, which may provide a potential target for the
clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND Although several complicated models have been built to evaluate the
prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy, simple economic models are
still needed to give a preliminary survival assessment of these patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS This study retrospectively assessed the clinical and
biological parameters of 223 patients with advanced NSCLC. Univariate and
multivariate analyses of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) for the parameters and the prognostic score were assessed. RESULTS
Performance status (PS) score=1, smoking history, fibrinogenemia, thrombocytosis,
increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and anemia were independent
predictors of poor prognosis in the univariate analysis of OS and were assessed
in multivariate analysis. There was a significant difference in PS=1 (HR=2.134,
p<0.0001), increased LDH level (HR=1.508, p=0.014), thrombocytosis (HR=1.547,
p=0.012), and smoking history (HR=1.491, p=0.008), based on which the patients
were classified into 3 risk groups: low risk (0-1 points), moderate risk (2
points), and high risk (3-5 points). At p values of <0.0001, the median OS was
565, 340, and 273 days and the median progression-free survival was 250, 209, and
135 days, respectively in these 3 risk groups. CONCLUSIONS We established a new
prognostic score model using PS, LDH level, PLT count, and smoking history to
predict the survival of patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for advanced
NSCLC, which might be useful in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies on check-point inhibitor therapy, which seems to
improve the prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma
increase the importance of immunohistochemical analyses of the programmed-death
receptor and of its ligand, PD-L1 protein.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study we present results of PD-L1
immunohistochemical tumor cell expression in a series of 325 lung carcinoma
patients biopsies, using the clone 22C3 (and DAKO Link 48 immunostainer).
Evaluation of the expression using tissue proportion scoring system allowed to
distinguish negative cases (either 0 % or < 1 % of positive tumor cells) versus
positive cases in the categories 1-9 %, 10-49 % and ≥ 50 % of positive tumor
cells.
RESULTS: In association to histopathologic parameters we observed similar rates
of positive expression in patients with adenocarcinoma types (47,8 % of all the
cases) as well as with squamous cell carcinomas (44,4 %). Within these
histological categories, the rates of positivity were similar also in patients
with small versus large (resectional) biopsies. In the biopsies of patients with 
adenocarcinoma we identified differences in the PD-L1 protein expression
associated with its histological subtype. In the cases with predominant lepidic
pattern the PD-L1 positivity was present in 18,8 %, with predominant acinar or
papillary pattern in 40,8 % and in cases with predominant solid or micropapillary
component in 74,1 % of the cases resp. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas were
positive in 38,5 % and non-keratinizing in 53,8 % of all the cases. The hiqhest
incidence of an extensive posivity was observed in sarcomatoid carcinoma type.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemically verified PD-L1 protein
expression represents a broadly accepted predictive biomarker for immunotherapy
of NSCLC patients. The indicated differences of the expression among various
NSCLC types and subtypes require to be verified in larger cohorts of patients in 
relation with clinical parameters to demonstrate whether it could be plausible to
use the PD-L1 expression in a role of a negative prognostic parameter.

Lung cancer still represents one of the most common and fatal neoplasm,
accounting for nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths. Targeted therapies based 
on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death
ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for 
patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway promotes tumor growth and
progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of
apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR
expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be
associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are
available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the
tumor's level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive
biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the
current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs 
in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with
chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status
of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in
patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ and immunohistochemistry
(IHC)-Score ≥ 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who
would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in
combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology.

PURPOSE: We characterized the early changes in cardiovascular biomarkers with
contemporary thoracic radiation therapy (RT) and evaluated their associations
with radiation dose-volume metrics including mean heart dose (MHD), V5, and V30.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective longitudinal study of 87 patients with
breast cancer, lung cancer, or mediastinal lymphoma treated with photon or proton
thoracic RT, blood samples were obtained pre-RT and after completion of RT
(median, 20 days; interquartile range [IQR], 1-35). High-sensitivity cardiac
troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, placental growth factor
(PIGF), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) were measured. Associations
between MHD, V5 and V30, and biomarker levels and associations between
echocardiography-derived measures of cardiac function and biomarker levels were
assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Analyses were performed
according to the following subgroups: (1) breast cancer alone and (2) lung cancer
and lymphoma combined.
RESULTS: The median (IQR) estimates of MHD ranged from 1.3 Gy (0.9-2.4) in breast
cancer (n = 60) to 6.8 Gy (5.4-10.2) in mediastinal lymphoma (n = 14) and 8.4 Gy 
(6.7-16.1) in lung cancer (n = 13) patients (P < .001). There were no significant
increases in biomarker levels from pre-RT to post-RT in breast cancer. In lung
cancer/lymphoma, PIGF increased from a median (IQR) of 20 ng/L (16-26) to 22 ng/L
(16-30) (P = .005), and GDF-15 increased from 1171 ng/L (755-2493) to 1887 ng/L
(903-3763) (P = .006). MHD, V5, and V30 were significantly associated with
post-RT PIGF and GDF-15 levels in multivariable models. Changes in biomarkers
were not significantly associated with changes in echocardiography-derived
measures of cardiac function.
CONCLUSION: Contemporary thoracic RT induces acute abnormalities in vascular and 
inflammatory biomarkers that are associated with radiation dose-volume metrics,
particularly in lung cancer and mediastinal lymphoma. Long-term follow-up studies
are needed to determine the impact of these changes on the development of overt
cardiac disease.

The KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger) gene family is composed 
of a large number of highly homologous genes, gene isoforms, and pseudogenes. The
proteins encoded by these genes, whose expression is often tissue-specific, act
as epigenetic suppressors contributing to the addition of repressive chromatin
marks and DNA methylation. Due to its high complexity, the KRAB-ZNF family has
not been studied in sufficient detail, and the involvement of its members in
carcinogenesis remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we aimed to provide a
comprehensive description of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs using publicly available
The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer datasets. We analyzed 6727 tumor and normal
tissue samples from 16 cancer types. Here, we showed that a small but distinctive
cluster of 16 KRAB-ZNFs is commonly upregulated across multiple cancer cohorts in
comparison to normal samples. We confirmed these observations in the independent 
panels of lung and breast cancer cell lines and tissues. This upregulation was
also observed for most of the KRAB-ZNF splicing variants, whose expression is
simultaneously upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, by
analyzing the clinicopathological data for breast and lung cancers, we
demonstrated that the expression of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs correlates with
patient survival, tumor histology, and molecular subtyping. Altogether, our study
allowed the identification and characterization of KRAB-ZNF factors that may have
an essential function in cancer biology and thus potential to become novel
oncologic biomarkers and treatment targets.

MicroRNAs, a class of short endogenous RNAs, acting as post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression, mostly silence gene expression via binding
imperfectly matched sequences in the 3'UTR of target mRNA. MiR-17-92, a highly
conserved gene cluster, has 6 members including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a,
miR-20a, miR-19b-1 and miR-92a. The miR-17-92 cluster, regarded as oncogene, is
overexpressed in human cancers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death all
over the world. The molecular mechanism of lung cancer has been partly known at
the levels of genes and proteins in last decade. However, new prognosis
biomarkers and more target drugs should be developed in future. Therefore,
noncoding RNAs, especially miRNAs, make them as new potentially clinical
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we focus the current
progress of miR-17-92 cluster in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus has been repeatedly associated with
exposure to smoking from the foetal period onwards. We explored whether DNA
methylation may be a mechanism that links exposure to maternal prenatal smoking
with offspring's adult cardio-metabolic health.
METHODS: We meta-analysed the association between DNA methylation at GFI1-locus
with maternal prenatal smoking, adult own smoking, and cardio-metabolic
phenotypes in 22 population-based studies from Europe, Australia, and USA
(n = 18,212). DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus was measured in whole-blood.
Multivariable regression models were fitted to examine its association with
exposure to prenatal and own adult smoking. DNA methylation levels were analysed 
in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose
(FG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG),
diastolic, and systolic blood pressure (BP).
FINDINGS: Lower DNA methylation at three out of eight GFI1-CpGs was associated
with exposure to maternal prenatal smoking, whereas, all eight CpGs were
associated with adult own smoking. Lower DNA methylation at cg14179389, the
strongest maternal prenatal smoking locus, was associated with increased WC and
BP when adjusted for sex, age, and adult smoking with Bonferroni-corrected
P < 0·012. In contrast, lower DNA methylation at cg09935388, the strongest adult 
own smoking locus, was associated with decreased BMI, WC, and BP (adjusted
1 × 10-7 < P < 0.01). Similarly, lower DNA methylation at cg12876356, cg18316974,
cg09662411, and cg18146737 was associated with decreased BMI and WC
(5 × 10-8 < P < 0.001). Lower DNA methylation at all the CpGs was consistently
associated with higher TG levels.
INTERPRETATION: Epigenetic changes at the GFI1 were linked to smoking exposure
in-utero/in-adulthood and robustly associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors.

Owing to the poor prognosis, novel biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LACA) are 
needed nowadays. The aim of the study was to identify the differential miRNAs
expression between lung cancer and normal tissues and evaluate the prognostic
values of the miRNAs. Multidimensional data of 528 samples were retrieved from
The Cancer Genome Atlas archive. Data analysis was based on a computational
approach to detect survival-associated molecular signatures. A total of 191
differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between LACA tissues and normal
tissues, including 88 up-regulated and 103 down-regulated miRNAs. The
Kaplan-Meier survival method revealed the prognostic function of the three miRNAs
(miR-1293, miR-873 and miR-1914). Cox regression analysis showed that the
three-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor in LACA. The
functional enrichment analysis suggested that the target genes of three miRNAs
may be involved in various pathways related to the cancer. This study
demonstrated that the three-miRNA signature (miR-1293, miR-873 and miR-1914)
could be used as a prognostic marker in LACA.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. The outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer remains poor; 
the 5-year survival rate for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer is only 1.0%.
KIF15 is a tetrameric kinesin spindle motor that has been investigated for its
regulation of mitosis. While the roles of kinesin motor proteins in the
regulation of mitosis and their potentials as therapeutic targets in pancreatic
cancer have been described previously, the role of KIF15 in lung cancer
development remains unknown.
METHODS: Paired lung carcinoma specimens and matched adjacent normal tissues were
used for protein analysis. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. We
first examined KIF15 messenger RNA expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas
database, and then determined KIF15 protein levels using immunohistochemistry and
western blotting. Differences between the groups were analyzed using repeated
measures analysis of variance. Overall survival was analyzed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Cell-cycle and proliferation assays were conducted using
A549, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H226 cells.
RESULTS: KIF15 was significantly upregulated at both the messenger RNA and
protein levels in human lung tumor tissues. In patients with lung adenocarcinoma,
KIF15 expression was positively associated with disease stages; high KIF15
expression predicted a poor prognosis. KIF15 knockdown using short hairpin RNA in
two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines induced G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and
inhibited cell growth, but there was no effect in human lung squamous cell
carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that KIF15 is involved in lung cancer
carcinogenesis. KIF15 could therefore serve as a specific prognostic marker for
patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Lung cancer as the major cause of cancer mortality worldwide includes several
histologic subtypes evolving from numerous genetic and epigenetic changes
emerging in alveolar, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium. The majority of cases
are diagnosed in advanced stage (i.e. stages IIIB and IV), often with scanty
amount of tissue in transbronchial biopsies or cytology specimens. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the expression of the scaffolding protein neural
precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) in small
biopsies of lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of NEDD9 was analyzed
immunohistochemically in 71 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded transbronchial
biopsy specimens of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Nuclear and cytoplasmic NEDD9
expression was detected indicating activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition process. Direct relationship between the expression of NEDD9 and
survival was not demonstrated.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most frequently encountered
progressive lung disease in clinical practice. This study sought to determine the
predictive ability of the tumor biomarker cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) in the
identification of COPD in a cohort of 284 patients with COPD living at high
altitude (with an average elevation of over 2500 m).Patients were classified by
pleural effusion volumes into 4 categories and serum CA-125 concentrations were
measured in each category. The analyses revealed that CA-125 concentrations were 
positively and significantly correlated with pleural effusion volume. CA-125
concentrations were also positively correlated with pulmonary heart disease and
acute exacerbations of COPD, and negatively correlated with pulmonary
hypertension.The study evidence suggests that serum CA-125 concentrations are
positively correlated with the risk of pleural effusions among patients with COPD
living in high-altitude areas, and that CA-125 concentrations are also correlated
with pulmonary heart disease, acute exacerbations, and pulmonary hypertension.

Mitochondrial (mt) DNA has been long suggested to contribute to carcinogenesis,
and a variety of mutations in mtDNA have been confirmed to be related to various 
early stages of cancers; these data revealed that the detection of mtDNA in
clinical samples may be a promising approach for cancer diagnosis. In the present
study, the serum mtDNA in healthy donors and groups of patients with cancer was
detected. It was revealed that patients with lung cancer without metastasis had
more mtDNA in serum compared to patients with metastasis. Moreover,
TLR9‑associated signalling was activated in vitro after treatment with a
synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) called ODN‑M362. In addition, our
data revealed that TLR9 and its adaptor protein, MyD88, were induced by ODN‑M362 
in a dose‑dependent manner. A human cytokine array to evaluate stimulation of
cytokine secretion by ODN‑M362 was also used. Our findings may identify the role 
that TLR9 and mtDNA play in lung cancer progression and metastasis.

Lysophospholipase1 (LYPLA1) also known as acyl‑protein thioesterase1 (APT1)
belongs to the superfamily of α/β hydrolase. It has been found to have the
properties of a homodimer by manifesting depalmitoylation as well as
lysophospholipase activity. LYPLAs are under the control of both microRNAs,
miR‑138 and miR‑424. They were observed to be significantly overexpressed in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To date, LYPLAs are the sole enzymes
recognized to activate depalmitoylation. In this study, we provide the expression
pattern of LYPLA1 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using four different
NSCLC cell lines. Western blot analysis and RT‑PCR were performed to detect the
protein expression and mRNA expression of LYPLA1 in NSCLC cell lines. We detected
the highest LYPLA1 protein expression level in SPC‑A‑1 cells followed by A549
cells, and the highest LYPLA1 mRNA expression level was detected in the SPC‑A‑1
cells followed by the H1299 cell line. We found that suppression of LYPLA1
expression using small‑interfering RNA significantly inhibited proliferation,
migration and invasion of the LYPLA1‑transfected NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we
explored the involvement of LYPLA1 in the regulation of epithelial‑mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The epithelial marker E‑cadherin was significantly increased,
while mesenchymal markers N‑cadherin, vimentin and SNAIL were markedly decreased 
in the LYPLA1‑silenced cells. Collectively the results of the present study
suggest that the LYPLA1 gene plays a tumor‑promotor role in NSCLC cells in vitro.
