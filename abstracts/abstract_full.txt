CD69 is an activation marker on leukocytes. Early studies showed that the CD69+
cells were detected in the lung of patients with asthmatic and eosinophilic
pneumonia, suggesting that CD69 might play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of
such inflammatory diseases, rather than simply being an activation marker.
Intensive studies using mouse models have since clarified that CD69 is a
functional molecule regulating the immune responses. We discovered that Myosin
light chain 9, 12a, 12b (Myl9/12) are ligands for CD69 and that platelet-derived 
Myl9 forms a net-like structure (Myl9 nets) that is strongly detected inside
blood vessels in inflamed lung. CD69-expressing activated T cells attached to the
Myl9 nets can thereby migrate into the inflamed tissues through a system known as
the CD69-Myl9 system. In this review, we summarize the discovery of the CD69-Myl9
system and discuss how this system is important in inflammatory immune responses.
In addition, we discuss our recent finding that CD69 controls the exhaustion
status of tumor-infiltrating T cells and that the blockade of the CD69 function
enhances anti-tumor immunity. Finally, we discuss the possibility of CD69 as a
new therapeutic target for patients with intractable inflammatory disorders and
tumors.

CASE REPORT: Case 1 of an investigator-initiated study using oral single agent
mifepristone to halt stage IV non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor was devoid
of any targeted markers has remained ECOG zero and in good health for over 3
years. Case 2, reported here, is a 68-year-old woman with stage IV non-small cell
lung cancer whose tumor was positive for the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
marker. Her cancer progressed despite treatment with a check-point inhibitor
(nivolumab), besides 3 rounds of multi-agent chemotherapy. After 1 ½ years of
treatment with single agent mifepristone, her cancer remains stable (even some
tumor regression) and her quality of life is only impaired by her pre-existing
chronic obstructive lung disease, not her cancer.
CONCLUSION: Mifepristone therapy may provide a method to halt metastatic lung
cancer positive for the PD-L1 marker when check-point inhibitors are no longer
effective.

EZH2 is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which
catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and promotes
carcinogenesis by epigenetically silencing many tumor suppressor genes. Increased
EZH2 expression is a marker of advanced and metastatic in many cancers, including
lung, prostate and breast cancer, and it has been considered as a potential novel
therapeutic target. However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms
of EZH2 controlling gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are not well
documented. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to
investigate the EZH2 expression in gastric cancer. We found that EZH2 levels were
increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
Moreover, patients with high levels of EZH2 expression had a relatively poor
prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown of EZH2 expression by siRNA could impair cell
proliferation and invasion both in vitro and vivo. Finally, we found that EZH2
influences gastric cancer cells proliferation partly through regulating p21
expression. Our findings present that EZH2 over-expression can be identified as a
poor prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer.

Multiplex electrochemical sensors for amperometric detection of glutathione
disulfide (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cyss),
β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) and coenzyme II reduced
tetrasodium salt (NADPH) were developed, in which analysis of Cyss, NADP+ and
NADPH are the first report using this sensing system. Specificity of these
sensors were ensured by a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was 
electropolymerized in situ with the analytes as template. All the sensors were
tested with standard buffers and mouse blood samples, showing satisfactory
performance towards the corresponding analytes. Dynamic concentration for the six
analytes was in the range of 10-11-10-8 mol/L with the detection limit down to 20
pmol/L. In addition, artificially synthesized MIP film on the electrodes allowed 
for good selectivity and stability. Real blood sample measurement proved that the
sensors owned decent accuracy with recovery value ranging from 92%~112%. More
importantly, blood samples from lung cancer patients and healthy donors were
assayed by using the proposed sensors. Redox potentials (Ehc) were calculated
based on the contents of these endogenic substances, which were utilized to
reflect the health status of human body and help diagnose lung cancer. The levels
of GSH, NADPH and the absolute value of Ehc(GSH/GSSG) in patients with lung
cancer are significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those in healthy people, while the
contents of GSSG (P < 0.01) are higher. The blood test results suggested that the
content of GSH, NADPH, NADP+ and Ehc(GSH/GSSG) might serve as biomarkers for lung
cancer prediagnosis. These novel sensors for liquid biospy of cancer have
cost-benefit and scalability advantage over current techniques, potentially
enabling broader clinical access and efficient population screening.

BACKGROUND: Development of noninvasive biomarkers could potentially contribute to
extending the 5-year overall survival rate of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), due to their high stability, have the
potential to become valuable cancer biomarkers.
METHODS: Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
testing three methods for data normalization, the expression levels of six miRNAs
were evaluated in serum samples obtained from 50 NSCLC patients. Subsequently,
the clinical significance of tested miRNAs was determined.
RESULTS: Significant downregulation of miR-21-5p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-126-3p and 
upregulation of miR-210-3p and miR-486-5p in serum samples of NSCLC patients were
identified in comparison to healthy controls. miR-205-5p appeared to be
undetectable in all tested samples. Furthermore, miR-210-3p was differentially
expressed between two subtypes of NSCLC. Receiver operating characteristic
analysis for miR-210-3p revealed the area under the curve of 0.842 (95%
confidence interval, 0.72-0.96; p = 0.0003) and demonstrated that miR-210-3p
displayed considerable accuracy in discriminating serum of lung adenocarcinoma
(AC) patients from serum of healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this preliminary study indicate that five of six
tested miRNAs were deregulated in serum of NSCLC patients. Moreover, miR-210-3p
appears to be a promising biomarker for diagnosis of lung AC.

Hypoxia plays an extensive role in the development of the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), particularly in mediating immunosuppression. Respiratory hyperoxia therapy
has the potential to improve the effects of conventional cancer therapies via
molecular mechanisms mediating antitumor immunity. Here, we investigated whether 
hyperoxia therapy can restore tumor immunity and inhibit lung metastases in a
mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by treating a 4T1 mammary
carcinoma mouse model with normoxia (21% oxygen) or hyperoxia (60% oxygen)
therapy, after tumor development. Using flow cytometry analysis, we observed
significant organ-specific expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
and protein expression upregulation of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in
the hypoxic TME of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice maintained under normoxia conditions,
with the TME converting to a T-cell immune-suppressive state as early as the
premetastatic phase. Markedly, hyperoxia treatments ameliorated hypoxia levels in
the lung TME and decreased the proportion of MDSCs and the expression of PD-L1 in
both the primary tumor and in the metastatic lung, when compared to animals
treated with respiratory normoxia therapy. In addition, the number of lung
metastatic nodes fell from 90 per lung in the normoxic treated group to 13 per
lung in the hyperoxic treated group (P < 0.05), with the latter having limited
hyperoxia effects on primary tumor growth (mammary glands). Notably, hyperoxia
therapy was characterized by the differential recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+
T-cells. Thus, our study confirms that hyperoxia therapy may be used to overcome 
TME immunosuppression and control the extend of lung metastases in TNBC.
Importantly, changes in immunosuppressive MDSCs frequency and PD-L1 expression
levels may serve as biomarkers of hypoxia levels in cancer affected tissues that 
can benefit from hyperoxia treatments.

Long follow up is needed in prospective cohort study evaluation of plasma
biomarkers for incident peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Middle-aged PAD-free
individuals from the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study
(n = 5550; 1991-94) were followed prospectively for a median time of 23.4 years. 
The plasma biomarkers lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity 
and mass, proneurotensin, and CRP, were studied in relation to incidence of PAD
until December 31st, 2016. The diagnosis of PAD could be validated and confirmed 
in 98%. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) per 1 standard
deviation increment of each respective log transformed plasma biomarker.
Cumulative incidence of PAD was 4.4% (men 5.9%, women 3.3%). Adjusting for age,
gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Lp-PLA2
activity (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.17-1.52), Lp-PLA2 mass (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37)
and CRP (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.36-1.76) remained independently associated with
incident PAD. The plasma biomarkers Lp-PLA2 activity and mass, and CRP were
markers of PAD risk, implying that they might be useful biomarkers for
subclinical atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the expression of vinculin in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to analyze its correlation with clinical features
and prognosis of NSCLC.
METHODS: The expression of vinculin in cancer tissues and paracancer tissues was 
detected by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.
Correlations between vinculin-positive expression and clinical features were
analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis, and those between vinculin expression
and prognosis were analyzed by Cox multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Vinculin expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in
paracancer tissues. Pearson correlation analysis showed that vinculin expression 
was significantly correlated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph
node metastasis in NSCLC. Cox multivariate analysis showed that vinculin-negative
expression and TNM stage were independent risk factors for NSCLC prognosis.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was
20.51% for all NSCLC patients, and was significantly higher for vinculin-positive
patients with NSCLC than vinculin-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Vinculin gene transcription is inhibited in NSCLC, and low vinculin 
expression promotes malignancy in NSCLC. Therefore, vinculin could be used as a
prognostic marker for NSCLC and a potential target for its treatment.

BACKGROUND: Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is an important plaque component of desmosomes, 
major intercellular adhesive junctions that act as anchorage points for
intermediate filaments. Abnormal expression of PKP1 was observed in various types
of cancer, however so far its function in lung cancer has not yet been
elucidated.
METHODS: The expression of PKP1 was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting in
lung cancer cell lines. The protein expression of PKP1 was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray. The epigenetic mechanism of PKP1 was
explored by demethylation test, bisulfite sequencing and
Methylation-Specific-PCR. The function of PKP1 was investigated by stable
transfection with an expression vector.
RESULTS: We found that PKP1 was downregulated in 6 out of 8 lung cancer cell
lines, and downregulation of PKP1 was associated with DNA hypermethylation. In
advanced primary lung tumor samples, higher expression of PKP1 was significantly 
associated with favorable clinical outcome (p = .003). Ectopic expression of PKP1
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion and enhanced
apoptosis. These phenomena are accompanied by increased caspase 3/7 activities
and cleaved PARP-1 as well as decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activity.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that PKP1 is a novel tumor
suppressor and its protein expression might be a potential prognostic marker for 
patients with advanced lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Genetic alterations, including mutation of epidermal growth factor
receptor or v-Ki-ras2 kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog and fusion of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), RET proto-oncogene (RET), or v-ros UR2 sarcoma 
virus oncogene homolog 1 (ROS1), occur in non-small cell lung cancers, and these 
oncogenic drivers are important biomarkers for targeted therapies. A useful
technique to screen for these fusions is the detection of native carboxy-terminal
(C-terminal) protein by immunohistochemistry; however, the effects of other
genetic alterations on C-terminal expression is not fully understood. In this
study, we evaluated whether C-terminal expression is specifically elevated by
fusion with or without typical genetic alterations of lung cancer.
METHODS: In 37 human lung cancer cell lines and four tissue specimens, protein
and mRNA levels were measured by capillary western blotting and reverse
transcription-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, mRNA levels at the
C-terminus of all five of the fusion-positive cell lines tested (three ALK, one
RET, and one ROS1) were elevated at least 2000-, 300-, or 2000-fold,
respectively, and high C-terminal protein expression was detected. In an ALK
fusion-positive tissue specimen, the mRNA and protein levels of C-terminal ALK
were also markedly elevated. Meanwhile, in one of 36 RET fusion-negative cell
lines, RET mRNA levels at the C-terminus were elevated at least 500-fold compared
with the median of all 37 cell lines, and high C-terminal protein expression was 
detected despite the absence of RET fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of 37 cell lines and four tissue specimens shows the
detection of C-terminal ALK or ROS1 proteins could be a comprehensive method to
determine ALK or ROS1 fusion, whereas not only the detection of C-terminal RET
protein but also other methods would be needed to determine RET fusion.

BACKGROUND: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B), a novel 
oncogene, promotes tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic biomarker in
several cancers. This study was to determine the clinical significance and
biological roles of LAPTM4B in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC).
METHODS: LAPTM4B expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 63 LAC 
tumors. Serum levels of LAPTM4B were measured by enzyme-linked immuosorbent
assays (ELISA). The study included untreated group (n = 216), chemotherapy group 
(n = 29), chemotherapy efficacy group (n = 179), EGFR-TKIs group (n = 57) and 68 
healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the correlation
between LAPTM4B expression and clinicopathological parameters in LAC.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of
LAPTM4B in LAC. In vitro assays were performed to assess the biological roles of 
LAPTM4B in LAC cells. Western blotting assays were examined to identify the
underlying pathways involved in the tumor-promoting role of LAPTM4B.
RESULTS: We found LAPTM4B was upregulated in LAC tissues and high LAPTM4B
expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Serum LAPTM4B levels
were significantly decreased after chemotherapy. Patients in invalid response
group showed higher LAPTM4B levels than the valid response group. Overexpression 
of LAPTM4B promoted, while silencing of LAPTM4B inhibited proliferation, invasion
and migration of LAC cells via PI3K/AKT and EMT signals. LAPTM4B expression level
was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. In
addition, LAPTM4B plays important roles in EGFR-promoted cell proliferation,
migration and invasion and gefitinib-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data propose that LAPTM4B may be a cancer
biomarker for LAC and a potential therapeutic target which facilitates the
development of a novel therapeutic strategy against LAC.

PURPOSE: The detection of pre-existing EGFR T790M subclones and the assessment of
their clinical significance in the pretreatment of EGFR T790M non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients remain unclear.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 179 tumor samples from patients treated or not
with a first-generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) was analyzed. The
presence of ultra-low levels of pre-existing EGFRT790M mutation was evaluated
using ultra-sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and the clinical implication of
these mutations on first-generation TKI efficiency assessed.
RESULTS: With a ddPCR linear performance of 0.999 and an analytical sensitivity
of approximately 0.001%, we observed a 66% (99/150) overall incidence of
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutation. Among 82 patients harboring EGFR activating
mutations, the presence of a pre-existing EGFR T790M mutation prior to any
treatment was significantly associated with a longer PFS (P = 0.009; Log-rank
test). Interestingly, longer PFS was linked to concomitant EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations. Moreover, the presence of both EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations was identified as the best fit for predicting the 
clinical outcome of patients treated with TKI compared with an ultra-low EGFR
T790M mutation status or an activating mutation alone (P = 0.042 and P = 0.0071, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the detection of the ultra-low EGFR T790M
mutation in TKI-naive patients is not a rare event. We suggest that ddPCR should 
be used in clinical practice to distinguish patients who may respond to first- or
third-generation TKIs.

Checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy is opening a promising scenario in
oncology, with objective responses registered in multiple cancer types. However, 
reliable predictive markers of tumor responsiveness are still lacking. These
markers need to be urgently identified for a better selection of patients that
can be candidates for immunotherapy. In this pilot study, a cohort of 34
consecutive patients bearing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab, was considered. The
retrospective immuno-phenotypic analysis performed on the original tumor biopsies
allowed for the identification of a specific "galectin signature", which strongly
correlated with tumor responsiveness to anti PD-1 immunotherapy. We observed that
the large majority of patients (about 90%) with high galectin-3 tumor expression 
(score 3+) showed an early and dramatic progression of the disease after three
cycles of treatments. In contrast, all patients with negative or low/intermediate
expression of galectin-3 in tumor cells showed an early and durable objective
response to pembrolizumab, indicating galectin-3 as an interesting predictive
marker of tumor responsiveness. The galectin-3 signature, at least in NSCLCs,
promises a better selection of patient candidates for immunotherapy, reducing
unnecessary treatment exposures and social costs. A large multicenter study is
ongoing to validate this finding.

Lung cancer, one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide has long
relied on testing for the molecular biomarkers EGFR/ALK. However, achieving
superior clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer requires developing
comprehensive techniques beyond contemporary EGFR/ALK testing. Current
technologies are on par with molecular testing for EGFR/ALK in terms of efficacy,
most of them failing to offer improvements perhaps primarily due to skepticism
among clinicians, despite being recommended in the NCCN guidelines. The present
study endeavored to minimize chemotherapy-dependence in EGFR/ALK-negative patient
cohorts, and use evidence-based methods to identify ways to improve clinical
outcomes. In total, 137 lung cancer cases obtained from 'PositiveSelect NGS
data', comprising 91 males and 46 females, were investigated. EGFR- and
ALK-positivity was used for data dichotomization to understand the therapeutic
utility of rare gene alterations beyond just EGFR/ALK. Statistics obtained from
PositiveSelect were collated with data from international studies to construct a 
meta-analysis intended to achieve better clinical outcomes. Upon dichotomization,
23% of cases harbored EGFR variants indicating that treating with EGFR TKIs would
be beneficial; the remaining 77% exhibited no EGFR variants that would indicate
favorable results using specific currently available chemotherapy practices.
Similarly, 28% of cases had EGFR+ALK variants favoring EGFR/ALK-based targeted
therapeutics; the remaining 72% harbored no EGFR/ALK variants with known
beneficial chemotherapy routes. The present study aimed to overcome current
inadequacies of targeted therapies in patients with a conventional
EGFR/ALK-positive diagnosis and those in EGFR+ALK-negative cohorts. Upon analysis
of the negative cohorts, significant and clinically relevant single nucleotide
variants were identified in KRAS, ERBB2, MET and RET, with frequencies of 7, 1, 2
and 3% in patients who were EGFR-negative and 6, 1, 1, and 3% in patients who
were EGFR and ALK-negative, respectively, enabling the use of targeted
therapeutics aside from EGFR/ALK TKIs. From the results of the current study only
35% of the two negative arms (EGFR negative and EGFR+ALK negative) would be
recommended NCCN or off-label chemotherapy; prior to the current study, the
entire cohorts would have been recommended this treatment. The present study
emphasizes the potential of comprehensive genomics in identifying hallmarks of
lung cancer beyond EGFR/ALK, using broad-spectrum genetic testing and
data-sharing among medical professionals to circumvent ineffective chemotherapy.

Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, P.R. China.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential prognostic value of
members of the heat shock protein (HSP)90 family in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients. The mRNA expression profiles of 1,926 NSCLC patients, which was
available from the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, were included in the study.
High expression of HSP90AA1 mRNA was significantly associated with a poorer rate 
of overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients [hazard ratio (HR), 1.21; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.37; P=0.004], as well as for patients with
adenocarcinoma (ADE; HR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.02-1.65; P=0.034), but no significant
correlation was identified for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (HR, 1.08; 
95% CI: 0.85-1.38; P=0.51). High expression of HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 mRNA was
significantly associated with poorer rates of OS in lung SCC and ADE patients
combined, as well as in lung ADE patients alone. By contrast, high expression of 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) mRNA was
significantly associated with improved OS rates in all NSCLC patients combined
(HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P=0.041), as well as ADE patients. In stratified
survival analysis, a high expression of HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 predicted 
poor prognosis in stage I NSLCC patients, suggesting that these genes may serve
as stage-independent prognostic indicators. As an elevated expression of
HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSP90B1 and TRAP1 was associated with poorer OS outcomes in
patients with NSCLC, these HSP90 members may be potential prognostic biomarkers
and drug targets for the treatment of NSCLC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver
with high mortality and frequent recurrence. Although various therapies provide
potential cure for HCC patients, unfortunately the five-year survival rate of
advanced HCC remains dismal. It is critical to explore the pathogenesis of HCC
and identify novel biomarkers for early HCC diagnosis. PSMD4 is a major receptor 
of the 26S proteasome involved in ubiquitindependent and proteasome-mediated
protein degradation. In our study, PSMD4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and
cell lines determined by Northern blot, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
The silencing of PSMD4 blocked cell proliferation and tumor growth, induced cell 
apoptosis and inhibited the proteasome activity. Western blot results showed that
the knockdown of PSMD4 blocked the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2),
phosphorylated Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (P-SRC) and Bcl-2, but improved the levels
of p53 and Bax in HCC, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and
endometrial cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicated that the 
subunit of 26S proteasome PSMD4 exerts as an oncogene in HCC and other cancers
via regulating the expression p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. These findings enriched the
pathogenesis of HCC, and provided a new biomarker for cancers diagnosis and a new
target for cancers therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Orthopedia homeobox protein (OTP) was recently demonstrated to be a
pulmonary neuroendocrine marker showing specificity for pulmonary carcinoid
tumors in histologic sections. Little is known of OTP performance and specificity
for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors in lung fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cell
blocks (CBs), however.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated OTP expression in lung non-neuroendocrine and
neuroendocrine tumor CBs to determine its diagnostic utility in these specimens. 
Pulmonary typical carcinoid (TC) and atypical carcinoid (AC), small-cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and squamous cell 
carcinoma (SQ) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) CBs were retrieved along with matched
surgical cases and assessed for nuclear OTP expression with immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 11) and 83% ACs (10 of 12), but
not in SCLC (0 of 9), LCNEC (0 of 9), SQ (0 of 10) or ADC (0 of 6) cytology
cases. Similar to the cytologic specimens, nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 
11) and 80% ACs (8 of 10) but in none of the SCLC (0 of 8), LCNEC (0 of 7), SQ (0
of 8) or ADC (0 of 6) resections. Both AC and TC CBs showed a similar percentage 
of cells expressing nuclear OTP. By contrast, in resection specimens, 30% ACs (3 
of 10) compared with 73% TC (8 of 11) cases showed >40% of cells nuclear OTP
staining. Nuclear OTP demonstrated 80-83% sensitivity and 100% specificity for
pulmonary carcinoid tumors in cytology and surgical specimens.
CONCLUSION: In the context of pulmonary malignancies, nuclear OTP
immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive and specific in distinguishing carcinoid
tumors from other pulmonary neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine malignancies in
cytologic and surgical specimens.

Arecoline is the primary alkaloid in betel nuts, which are known as a risk factor
for oral submucosal fibrosis and oral cancer. Lung cancer is a severe type of
carcinoma with high cell motility that is difficult to treat. However, the
detailed mechanisms of the correlation between Arecoline and lung cancer are not 
fully understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Arecoline on migration in
lung cancer cell lines and its potential mechanism through the muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor 3 (mAChR3)-triggered EGFR/Src/FAK pathway. Our results
indicate that different concentrations of Arecoline treatment (10 µM, 20 µM, and 
40 µM) significantly increased the cell migration ability in A549 and CL1-0 cells
and promoted the formation of the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton, which
is a crucial element for cell migration. However, migration of H460, CL1-5, and
H520 cell lines, which have a higher migration ability, was not affected by
Arecoline treatment. The EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway, which is responsible for cell
migration, was activated by Arecoline treatment, and a decreased expression level
of E-cadherin, which is an epithelial marker, was observed in Arecoline-treated
cell lines. Blockade of the EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway with the inhibitors of EGFR
(Gefitinib) or c-Src (Dasatinib) significantly prevented Arecoline-promoted
migration in A549 cells. Gefitinib or Dasatinib treatment significantly disrupted
the Arecoline-induced localization of phospho-Y576-Fak during focal adhesion in
A549 cells. Interestingly, Arecoline-promoted migration in A549 cells was blocked
by a specific mAChR3 inhibitor (4-DAMP) or a neutralizing antibody of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP7 or Matrilysin). Taken together, our findings suggest that
mAChR3 might play an essential role in Arecoline-promoted EGFR/c-Src/Fak
activation and migration in an A549 lung cancer cell line.

Smoking cessation prolongs survival and decreases mortality of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, epigenetic alterations of some
genes are associated with survival. However, potential interactions between
smoking cessation and epigenetics have not been assessed. Here, we conducted an
epigenome-wide interaction analysis between DNA methylation and smoking cessation
on NSCLC survival. We used a two-stage study design to identify DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interactions that affect overall survival for
early-stage NSCLC. The discovery phase contained NSCLC patients from USA, Spain, 
Norway, and Sweden. A histology-stratified Cox proportional hazards model
adjusted for age, sex, clinical stage, and study center was used to test DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interaction terms. Interactions with FDR-q ≤ 0.05
were further confirmed in a validation phase using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database. Histology-specific interactions were identified by stratification
analysis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
patients. We identified one CpG probe (cg02268510SIPA 1L3 ) that significantly
and exclusively modified the effect of smoking cessation on survival in LUAD
patients (HRinteraction = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07-1.16; P = 4.30×10-7 ). Further, the 
effect of smoking cessation on early-stage LUAD survival varied across patients
with different methylation levels of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Smoking cessation only 
benefited LUAD patients with low methylation (HR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.82; P =
4.61×10-3 ) rather than medium or high methylation (HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.86-1.70;
P = 0.266) of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Moreover, there was an antagonistic
interaction between elevated methylation of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 and smoking
cessation (HRinteraction = 2.1835; 95% CI: 1.27-3.74; P = 4.46 × 10-3 ). In
summary, smoking cessation benefited survival of LUAD patients with low
methylation at cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . The results have implications for not only
smoking cessation after diagnosis, but also possible methylation-specific drug
targeting.

PURPOSE: Cancer stem cells (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
pathways are crucial for cancer progression. However, synergistic interactions
between CSC and EMT are not clear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study was to investigate CSC markers such as CD44, NANOG, and
ALDH1 expression and its correlation with EMT markers in NSCLC patients. Its
association with survival was also determined.
METHODS: CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 protein expression was evaluated in 267 resected 
NSCLC and its correlation with e-cadherin, β-catenin, p120 catenin, vimentin,
SNAIL, and TWIST expressions was determined based on immunohistochemical and mRNA
expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analyses
also were performed based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data from
Gene Expression Omnibus dataset.
RESULTS: ALDH1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was positively correlated with
the epithelial-like phenotype, low vimentin and low TWIST in immunohistochemical 
and mRNA expression data. NANOG and ALDH1 expressions measured by
immunohistochemical and mRNA expression profiling data of adenocarcinomas were
associated with a favorable prognosis. ALDH1 was an independent favorable
prognostic marker for overall survival or recurrence-free survival in
adenocarcinoma (P = 0.026 and P = 0.033, respectively). The epithelial-like
phenotype expressing P120-catenin and beta-catenin was associated with a
favorable prognosis; however, the TWIST-expressing mesenchymal-like phenotype was
correlated with an unfavorable prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: NANOG and ALDH1 protein or mRNA expression showed improved prognosis
in adenocarcinoma alone. ALDH1 expression correlated with an epithelial-like
phenotype.

PURPOSE: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity (RICT) is an increasingly
well-appreciated source of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving thoracic
radiotherapy (RT). Currently available methods to predict RICT are suboptimal. We
investigated circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) as potential biomarkers of RICT in 
patients undergoing definitive RT for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Data from 63 patients treated on institutional trials were analyzed.
Prognostic models of grade 3 or greater (G3 +) RICT based on pre-treatment
c-miRNA levels ('c-miRNA'), mean heart dose (MHD) and pre-existing cardiac
disease (PCD) ('clinical'), and a combination of these ('c-miRNA + clinical')
were developed. Elastic net Cox regression and full cross validation were used
for variable selection, model building, and model evaluation. Concordance
statistic (c-index) and integrated Brier score (IBS) were used to evaluate model 
performance.
RESULTS: MHD, PCD, and serum levels of 14 c-miRNA species were identified as
jointly prognostic for G3 + RICT. The 'c-miRNA and 'clinical' models yielded
similar cross-validated c-indices (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and IBSs (0.26
and 0.28, respectively). However, prognostication was not improved by combining
c-miRNA and clinical factors (c-index 0.70, IBS 0.28). The 'c-miRNA' and
'clinical' models were able to significantly stratify patients into high- and
low-risk groups of developing G3 + RICT. Chi-square testing demonstrated a
marginally significantly higher prevalence of PCD in patients with high- compared
to low-risk c-miRNA profile (p = 0.09), suggesting an association between some
c-miRNAs and PCD.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a pre-treatment c-miRNA signature prognostic for
G3 + RICT. With further development, pre- and mid-treatment c-miRNA profiling
could contribute to patient-specific dose selection and treatment adaptation.

Summary: Former uranium miners of the Wismut Company, East Germany, have been
exposed to ionizing radiation from radon decay products and therefore were at
high risk for lung cancer. Since histological types of cancer in the so called
Wismut cohort revealed an association of high radon exposure with a higher
relative frequency of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), we used comparative
proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in serum exposed
uranium miners with SqCC.
Methode: Pooled sera of exposed former uranium miners without lung disease and
pooled sera of former uranium miners with SqCC were analysed by 2-D gel
electrophoresis. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed from reproducable, significantly, at 
least 5-fold up-regulated protein spots. Proteins were identified by MASCOT
peptide mass fingerprint search. Additionally a receiver operating characteristic
curve for CYFRA 21-1 was created.
Results: The protein spots were identified as Keratin 10 (K10), Keratin 1 (K1),
complement factor H (CFH) and a haptoglobin (Hpt) fragment. The sensitivity for
CYFRA 21-1 reveals 60% at a specifity of 95 and 80% at a specifity of 80%.
Plotting the sensitivity against specifity reveals an AUC of 0.88.
Conclusion: In SqCC Keratin 10 and 1 were strongly induced. This was associated
with CYFRA 21-1, confirming the cytokeratin fragment as a tumormarker.

Conflict of interest statement: Former German uranium miners were offered a
medical surveillance programme (including laboratory parameters, x-ray
examination of the lungs, lung function and examination) by the ZeBWis (Zentrale 
Betreuungsstelle Wismut), a special department of the German Occupational
Accident Insurance Associations responsible for health care and support of former
SAG/SDAG Wismut employees. The German federal ministry for the environment
enabled the establishment of the so called Wismut cohort to preserve the health
data. A multicenter project investigating biomarkers with regard to lung cancer
has been implemented and published earlier. All participants gave their consent
to this project. At that time no ethical approval was required since the
individuals participated voluntarily in the study. All data were analyzed
anonymously. In the present study only former data and already frozen sera were
analysed with modern laboratory methods, which were not available at that time.
For the purpose of assessment and quality assurance no further ethic votes were
required.The manuscript does not contain individual person’s data in any form.The

BACKGROUND: Clinically-available biomarkers to identify the fraction of patients 
with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) are lacking. High nonsynonymous tumor mutational burden (TMB), as assessed
by whole exome sequencing, correlates with improved clinical outcomes for
patients with SCLC treated with ICIs. Whether TMB as assessed by targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) is associated with improved efficacy of ICIs in
patients with SCLC is currently unknown. Here we determined whether TMB by
targeted NGS is associated with efficacy of ICIs in patients with SCLC.
METHODS: We collected clinicopathologic data from patients with relapsed or
refractory SCLC which underwent targeted NGS with TMB assessment by the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute OncoPanel platform. The relationship between TMB and
clinical outcomes after treatment with ICIs was investigated.
RESULTS: Among the 52 patients treated with ICIs, we found no significant
difference in the objective response rate (ORR) between patients with a TMB above
the 50th percentile ("TMB high") and those with a TMB at or below the 50th
percentile ("TMB low"). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median
overall survival (mOS) were significantly longer in patients with a high TMB
compared to those with a low TMB (mPFS: 3.3 versus 1.2 months, HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 
0.20-0.69], P < 0.01; mOS: 10.4 versus 2.5 months, HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.19-0.77], 
P < 0.01). The one-year PFS and OS rates improved with increasing mutational load
when TMB was divided into tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that targeted NGS, a readily available clinical 
diagnostic test, can be used to identify patients with SCLC who are most likely
to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression.
Besides their well-characterized inhibitory effects on mRNA stability and
translation, miRs can also activate gene expression. In this study, we identified
a novel noncanonical function of miR-574-5p. We found that miR-574-5p acts as an 
RNA decoy to CUG RNA-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) and antagonizes its function.
MiR-574-5p induces microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression by 
preventing CUGBP1 binding to its 3'UTR, leading to an enhanced alternative
splicing and generation of an mPGES-1 3'UTR isoform, increased mPGES-1 protein
expression, PGE2 formation, and tumor growth in vivo. miR-574-5p-induced tumor
growth in mice could be completely inhibited with the mPGES-1 inhibitor CIII.
Moreover, miR-574-5p is induced by IL-1β and is strongly overexpressed in human
nonsmall cell lung cancer where high mPGES-1 expression correlates with a low
survival rate. The discovered function of miR-574-5p as a CUGBP1 decoy opens up
new therapeutic opportunities. It might serve as a stratification marker to
select lung tumor patients who respond to the pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 
formation.-Saul, M. J., Baumann, I., Bruno, A., Emmerich, A. C., Wellstein, J.,

Currently, there are few studies on patients with nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma,
and the pathogenesis is still unclear. The role of DNA methylation in the
pathogenesis of cancer is gradually being recognized. The purpose of this study
was to determine the abnormal methylation genes and pathways involved in
nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Gene expression microarray data
(GSE10072, GSE43458) and gene methylation microarray data (GSE62948) were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and differentially
expressed genes were obtained through GEO2R. Next, we analyzed the function and
enrichment of the selected genes using Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were
constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database
and visualized in Cytoscape. Finally, we performed module analysis of the PPI
network using Molecular Complex Detection. And we obtained 10 hub genes by
Cytoscape Centiscape. We analyzed the independent prognostic value of each hub
gene in nonsmoking nonsmall cell lung cancer patients through Kaplan-Meier
plotter. Seven hub genes (CXCL12, CDH1, CASP3, CREB1, COL1A1, ERBB2, and ENO2)
were closely related to the overall survival time. This study provides an
effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and
prognosis of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Hub genes with prognostic
value could be selected as effective biomarkers for timely diagnosis and
prognostic of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients.

Objectives: Molecular profiling of tumours has become the mainstay of diagnostics
for metastasised solid malignancies and guides personalised treatment, especially
in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In current practice, it is often
challenging to obtain sufficient tumour material for reliable molecular analysis.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood or other bio-sources could present an alternative 
approach to obtain genetic information from the tumour. In a retrospective cohort
we analysed the added value of cfDNA analysis in pleural effusions for molecular 
profiling.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed both the supernatant and the cell pellet of 
44 pleural effusions sampled from 39 stage IV patients with KRAS (n=23) or EGFR
(n=16) mutated tumours to detect the original driver mutation as well as for EGFR
T790M resistance mutations. Patients were diagnosed with either NSCLC (n=32),
colon carcinoma (n=4), appendiceal carcinoma (n=2) or adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary (n=1). Samples collected in the context of routine clinical care were
stored at the Netherlands Cancer Institute biobank. We used droplet digital PCR
for analysis.
Results: The driver mutation could be detected in 36 of the 44 pleural effusions 
by analysis of both the supernatant (35 out of 44 positive) and the cell pellet
(31 out of 44 positive). In seven out of 20 pleural effusions from patients with 
EGFR mutation-positive tumours, a T790M mutation was detected. All seven
supernatants and cell pellets were positive.
Conclusions: cfDNA in pleural effusion can be used to detect driver mutations as 
well as resistance mechanisms like EGFR T790M in pleural effusion with high
accuracy and is therefore a valuable bio-source.

BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has considerably
expanded the armamentarium against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
contributing to reshaping treatment paradigms in the advanced disease setting.
While promising tissue- and plasma-based biomarkers are under investigation, no
reliable predictive factor is currently available to aid in treatment selection.
METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC receiving nivolumab at Sant'Andrea
Hospital and Regina Elena National Cancer Institute from June 2016 to July 2017
were enrolled onto this study. Major clinicopathological parameters were
retrieved and correlated with patients' survival outcomes in order to assess
their prognostic value and build a useful tool to assist in the decision making
process.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. The median age was 
69 years (range 44-85 years), 69 (68%) were male and 52% had ECOG PS 0.
Loco-regional/distant lymph nodes were the most commonly involved site of
metastasis (71%), followed by lung parenchyma (67%) and bone (26%). Overall
survival (OS) in the whole patients' population was 83.6%, 63.2% and 46.9% at 3, 
6 and 12 months, respectively; while progression-free survival (PFS) was 66.5%,
44.4% and 26.4% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. At univariate analysis,
age ≥ 69 years (P = 0.057), ECOG PS (P < 0.001), the presence of liver
(P < 0.001), lung (P = 0.017) metastases, lymph nodes only involvement
(P = 0.0145) were significantly associated with OS and ECOG PS (P < 0.001) and
liver metastases (P < 0.001), retained statistical significance at multivariate
analysis. A prognostic nomogram based on three variables (liver and lung
metastases and ECOG PS) was built to assign survival probability at 3, 6, and
12 months after nivolumab treatment commencement.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram based on easily available and inexpensive
clinical factors showing a good performance in predicting individual OS
probability among NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. This prognostic device
could be valuable to clinicians in more accurately driving treatment decision in 
daily practice as well as enrollment onto clinical trials.

Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, mainly due to its
late diagnoses. The detection of molecular markers on samples provided from
routine bronchoscopy including several liquid-based cytology tests (e.g.,
bronchoaspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or on easily obtained specimens such
as sputum could represent a new approach to improve the sensitivity in lung
cancer diagnoses. Recently growing interest has been reported for "noninvasive"
liquid biopsy as a valuable source for molecular profiling. Unfortunately, a
biomarker and/or composition of biomarkers capable of detecting early-stage lung 
cancer has yet to be discovered even if in the last few years there has been,
through the use of revolutionary new technologies, an explosion of lung cancer
biomarkers. Assay sensitivity and specificity need to be improved particularly
when new approaches and/or tools are used. We have focused on the most important 
markers detected in tissue, and on several cytological specimens and liquid
biopsies overall.

Objective: To explore the correlation between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of small cell lung
cancer (SCLC). Methods: The clinicopathological data of 64 patients with small
cell lung cancer from January 2013 to December 2016 in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The
correlation between PD-L1 expression and the clinicopathological features and
prognosis of SCLC was analyzed. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed
that PD-L1 expression was observed in 60.9% (39/64) of patients with small cell
lung cancer. PD-L1 expression was significantly related to stages (P<0.001).
Univariate analysis showed that the median overall survival of PD-L1 negative
group was longer than PD-L1 positive group (16 months vs 14 months, P<0.001).
Median progression-free survival of PD-L1 negative group was longer than PD-L1
positive group(15 months vs 9 months, P<0.000 1). In multivariate analysis, PD-L1
positive was significantly correlated with inferior progression-free survival
(P=0.006). Conclusions: PD-L1 expression rate was high in small cell lung cancer.
PD-L1 expression was an independent predictor for poor prognosis of patients with
small cell lung cancer.

示，PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位总生存时间为16个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(14个月，P<0.001)。PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位无进展生存时间为1
5个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(9个月，P<0.000
1)。多因素分析结果显示，PD－L1的阳性表达是影响SCLC患者无进展生存时间的独立危险因素(P＝0.006)。 结论：
PD－L1在SCLC患者中高表达，PD－L1阳性表达是SCLC的独立不良预后因素。.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly refractory to therapy and associated with poor
clinical outcome. Here, we reveal a critical function of the promitotic and
adhesion-mediating discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) in modulating GBM therapy
resistance. In GBM cultures and clinical samples, we show a DDR1 and GBM stem
cell marker co-expression that correlates with patient outcome. We demonstrate
that inhibition of DDR1 in combination with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide
in GBM models enhances sensitivity and prolongs survival superior to conventional
therapy. We identify a 14-3-3-Beclin-1-Akt1 protein complex assembling with DDR1 
to be required for prosurvival Akt and mTOR signaling and regulation of
autophagy-associated therapy sensitivity. Our results uncover a mechanism driven 
by DDR1 that controls GBM therapy resistance and provide a rationale target for
the development of therapy-sensitizing agents.

Cryptotanshinone (CTS) was reported to repress a variety of systemic inflammation
and alleviate cardiac fibrosis, but it is still unclear whether CTS could prevent
radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Here, we investigated the effects and
underlying mechanisms of CTS on a RILI rat model. Our data revealed that CTS
could efficiently preserve pulmonary function in RILI rats and reduce early
pulmonary inflammation infiltration elicited, along with marked decreased levels 
of IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, we found that CTS is superior to prednisone in
attenuating collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis, in parallel with a marked
drop of HYP (a collagen indicator) and α-SMA (a myofibroblast marker).
Mechanistically, CTS inhibited profibrotic signals TGF-β1 and NOX-4 expressions, 
while enhancing the levels of antifibrotic enzyme MMP-1 in lung tissues. It is
noteworthy that CTS treatment, in consistent with trichrome staining analysis,
exhibited a clear advantage over PND in enhancing MMP-1 levels. However, CTS
exhibited little effect on CTGF activation and on COX-2 suppression. Finally, CTS
treatment significantly mitigated the radiation-induced activation of CCL3 and
its receptor CCR1. In summary, CTS treatment could attenuate RILI, especially
pulmonary fibrosis, in rats. The regulation on production and release of
inflammatory or fibrotic factors IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β1, NOX-4, and MMP-1,
especially MMP-1 and inhibition on CCL3/CCR1 activation, may partly attribute to 
its attenuating RILI effect.

The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung cancer have not yet been explored
systematically at the genome scale despite their important regulatory functions. 
Here, we report an integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA sequencing data for 
tumor and matched normal samples from 109 Korean female patients with
non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma. We produced miRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data for 48
patients and RNA-Seq data for 61 additional patients. Subsequent differential
expression analysis with stringent criteria yielded 44 miRNAs and 2,322 genes.
Integrative gene set analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and genes
using miRNA-target information revealed several regulatory processes related to
the cell cycle that were targeted by tumor suppressor miRNAs. We performed colony
formation assays in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines to test the tumor suppressive
activity of down-regulated miRNAs in cancer and identified 7 novel tumor
suppressor miRNAs (miR-144-5p, miR-218-1-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-30a-3p, 
miR-30c-2-3p, miR-338-5p). Two miRNAs, miR-30a-3p and miR-30c-2-3p, showed
differential survival characteristics in the TCGA LUAD patient cohort indicating 
their prognostic value. Finally, we identified a network cluster of miRNAs and
target genes that could be responsible for cell cycle regulation. Our study not
only provides a dataset of miRNA as well as mRNA sequencing from the matched
tumor-normal samples, but also reports several novel tumor suppressor miRNAs that
could potentially be developed into prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic RNA
drugs.

Antibodies that target programmed death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) have become a mainstay of first-line treatment of
advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable genetic
alterations. In this review, we summarize results from recent clinical trials
that have evaluated the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the 
anti-PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab as first-line treatment as
monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, other immunotherapies, and
anti-angiogenesis agents. We discuss factors that may influence treatment
selection, including patient baseline clinical and demographic characteristics,
tumor histology, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation
burden. While immunotherapy has become a central component of first-line
treatment for most patients with advanced NSCLC, important questions remain about
how treatment should be managed for individual patients.

Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1) plays a significant
role in cell proliferation and development. Its regulation in humans is very
critical and incompletely understood in Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: 100 newly diagnosed NSCLC (lung adenocarcinoma) patients and 100 healthy
controls were included and allele specific (AS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to genotype and expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR.
Overall survival of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and for
prognostic significance ROC curve was plotted. Results: A statistically
significant difference (p<0.0001) in CC, AA and CA genotypes distribution among
patients and healthy controls was observed. Compared to the CC genotype as
reference, OR was 30.40 (95%CI 1.75- 524.9, p=0.0002) and 3.97 (95%CI 1.49-10.52,
p=0.003) for the homozygous AA and heterozygous CA genotypes respectively.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed to analyze the relationship of 
EGFR1 (-191C/A) genotypes with progression free median survival of NSCLC patients
and the difference was found to be significantly (p=0.0002) associated with
different genotypes. In the ROC curve with respect to TNM stage at optimal
cut-off value of 9.88 fold increase in EGFR1 mRNA expression, sensitivity and
specificity were 92.9%, 83.3% respectively (AUC=0.95, p<0.0001). ROC curve w.r.t.
distant metastases at optimal cut-off value of 13.5 fold change EGFR1 mRNA
expression, sensitivity and specificity were 68.2%, 71.4% respectively (AUC=0.81,
p<0.0001). In ROC curve w.r.t to presence/ absence of pleural effusion at optimal
cut-off value of 14.8 fold change EGFR1 mRNA expression sensitivity and
specificity were 66.7%, 68.2% respectively (AUC=0.71, p=0.009). Conclusions:
Study concluded EGFR1 promoter polymorphism could be a risk factor associated
with disease and may be used as prognostic marker for patients’ survival and
predictor for disease worseness.

Hes3 is a basic helix-loop-helix factor gene, which was found to be involved in
neural cell differentiation. Expression and clinicopathological significance of
Hes3 in non-small cell lung cancer was not clear. In this study, we used
immunohistochemistry to examine Hes3 expression in normal human lung and
non-small cell lung cancer tissues. Hes3 expression was detected in cytoplasm and
nucleus. Hes3 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and epithelial cells of
submucosal glands was relatively weak and the positive rate was of 30.3% (10/33).
Hes3 expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues (51.8% (58/112)) was
significantly higher than that in normal lung tissues (p < 0.05). Hes3 expression
in cancer tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation,
advanced TNM stages, lymph node metastasis, and a shorter patient survival time
(p < 0.05). In vitro study showed that overexpression of Hes3 in A549 cells
significantly promoted cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while inhibition
of Hes3 expression significantly downregulated cancer cell proliferation and
invasion (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that overexpression of Hes3
significantly upregulated expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7 in A549
cells, while inhibition of Hes3 expression in LK2 cells significantly
downregulated the expression of these molecules (p < 0.05). These results
indicated that Hes3 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of non-small cell
lung cancer, possibly through regulation of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7, and
may be a promising cancer marker.

Comparatively less toxic and more tolerated, epidermal growth factor
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are recommendable for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations. Some
EGFR wild-type patients with specific biomarkers also show a response to the
drug. TAZ is an oncogene closely associated with the therapeutic effect of
EGFR-TKIs. However, this association remains to be clarified. This study aimed to
clarify the mechanism through which TAZ sensitizes EGFR wild-type NSCLC to
gefitinib. We used CCK-8 assays and in vivo experiments to investigate the
influence of TAZ on gefitinib in EGFR wild-type NSCLC. To further validate the
tumorigenic role of TAZ, we performed Human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC) tube formation and migration assays. Luciferase reporter assays,
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting and Chromatin
immunoprecipitation collaborated with qPCR illuminated the mechanism through
which TAZ caused those phenotypes. The results showed TAZ promoted the
angiogenesis of NSCLC cell lines and improved gefitinib sensitivity in EGFR
wild-type NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assays and ChIP-qPCR
experiments showed TAZ upregulated AREG by promoting its transcription. EGFR
signaling pathway was activated as TAZ was highly expressed. Rescue experiments
were conducted to confirm the indispensable role of AREG in tumorigenesis and
gefitinib sensitivity regulated by TAZ. Our study concluded that TAZ sensitized
EGFR wild-type NSCLC to gefitinib through promoting amphiregulin transcription.

BACKGROUND: Stathmin-1regulates microtubule dynamics and is associated with
malignant phenotypes in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluated 
its diagnostic value for differentiating between NSCLC and high-grade
neuroendocrine tumor (HGNET).
METHODS: Stathmin-1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
in surgical specimens of 414 NSCLC (305 adenocarcinoma [AD], 102 squamous cell
carcinoma [SCC], 7 large-cell carcinoma [LA]), 5 typical carcinoid (TC; a
low-grade neuroendocrine tumor), and 34 HGNET (17 small-cell carcinoma [SCLC] and
17 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [LCNEC]) and biopsy specimens of 57 NSCLCs
(29 AD and 28 SCC) and 42 HGNETs (17 LCNEC and 25 SCLC). We also analyzed
stathmin-1 mRNA levels in 81 NSCLC and 26 HGNET using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Among NSCLC samples, we saw high stathmin-1 protein expression in only 3
AD, 1 SCC and 1 LA surgical samples, all 5 of which showed neuroendocrine
characteristics in pathological re-review; and low or intermediate expression in 
all 5 TC surgical samples and all 57 NSCLC biopsy samples. In contrast, all HGNET
surgical (n=34) and biopsy (n=42) samples showed highstathmin-1 expression. In
RT-PCR, stathmin-1expression was significantly higher in HGNET tissues than in
NSCLC tissues (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Stathmin-1 expression can help in differentiating NSCLC from HGNET.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
Eastern Asia. The prognosis of LC highly depends on tumor stages and early
detection could substantially reduce LC mortality. Accumulating evidence
suggested that circulating miRNAs in plasma or serum may have applications in
early LC detection. We thus conducted a systematic literature review on the
diagnostic value of miRNAs markers for LC in East Asian populations.
METHODS: PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to retrieve relevant
articles published up to 17 September 2018. Information on study design,
population characteristics, investigated miRNAs and diagnostic accuracy
(including sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC)) were
independently extracted by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Overall, 46 studies that evaluated a total of 88 miRNA markers for LC
diagnosis in East Asian populations were identified. Sixteen of the 46 studies
have incorporated individual miRNA markers as panels (with 2⁻20 markers). Three
promising miRNA panels with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥90% specificity were
discovered, two of which were externally validated. Diagnostic performance of
circulating miRNAs in East Asian populations was comparable to previously
summarized performance in Western populations. Forty-four miRNAs were reported in
both populations. No major differences in diagnostic performance by ethnicity of 
the same miRNA was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miRNAs or miRNA panels, possibly in combination with
other promising molecular markers including epigenetic and genetic markers, may
be promising candidates for noninvasive LC early detection. However, large
studies with samples collected prospectively in true screening settings are
required to validate the promising markers or marker panels.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the major causes of carcinoma-related deaths in
the world. Importantly, lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the most common type with
poor outcome. However, the progressive clinical phenotype and biomolecular
signature of lung cancer presenting the cancer stem-like and metastatic
characteristics are still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we identified CD44 marker in lung cancers. The
capabilities, including tumorigenic and migration assays, were analyzed in CD44
expression and CD44 expression subgroups. Meanwhile, the potential bio-signature 
and properties of lung tumor stem-like cells were further studied.
RESULTS: The high expression of CD44 subpopulation (CD44-positive) in isolated
lung cancer cells showed significantly higher abilities of tumorigenic colonies, 
tumor-sphere formation, and migratory properties when compared with the CD44
expression group. These subgroups of CD44-positive lung cancer cells further
demonstrated the metastatic potential with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), as well as the high expression of Twist and Snail gene profile.
Importantly, the overexpression of Snail with gene vector in CD44 expression
cells further significantly promoted the properties of lung tumor stem-like
cells.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlighted the role of CD44-posivite
subpopulation in modulating tumor initiation and EMT-based metastatic ability of 
lung malignancy.

High mortality rates caused by NSCLC show the need for the identification of
novel therapeutic targets. In this study we have investigated the biological
effects and molecular mechanisms elicited by TMPRSS4 in NSCLC. Overexpression of 
TMPRSS4 in LKR13 cells increased malignancy, subcutaneous tumor growth and
multiorganic metastasis. In conditional knock-down (KD) experiments, abrogation
of TMPRSS4 in H358 and H2170 cells altered proliferation, clonogenicity, tumor
engraftment and tumor growth. Reduction in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
decreased BrdU incorporation and increased apoptosis was also found.
Transcriptomic analysis in KD cells revealed downregulation of genes involved in 
DNA replication, such as MCM6, TYMS and CDKN1A (p21). In patients, expression of 
a signature of MCM6/TYMS/TMPRSS4 genes was highly associated with poor prognosis.
Downregulation of TMPRSS4 significantly increased sensitivity to chemotherapy
agents. In experiments using cisplatin, apoptosis and expression of the
DNA-damage marker γ-H2A was higher in cells lacking TMPRSS4. Moreover, in vivo
assays demonstrated that tumors with no TMPRSS4 were significantly more sensitive
to cisplatin than controls. These results show that TMPRSS4 can be considered as 
a novel target in NSCLC, whose inhibition increases chemosensitivity.

CA199 is a sialic acid containing glycan antigen found in both glycoproteins and 
glycolipids, which is recognized by monoclonal antibodies generated by hybridoma 
technology. The increased serum CA199 levels measured by using the monoclonal
antibodies have been used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for pancreatic
cancer. Even though increased serum CA199 levels are also observed in other
cancers and noncancer diseases, it is largely unknown if CA199 levels could serve
as biomarkers for other diseases as well. Therefore, in our current study, serum 
CA199 levels from 45,645 patients with 47 clinically defined diseases and 14,783 
healthy controls who attended their annual physical examination were collected
and measured by the clinical laboratory in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao
University over the past 5 years. Based on the median, mean, and -Log10p values, 
we found that patients with pancreatic cancer, lung fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver
cancer, hepatitis, and pancreatitis had the highest media and mean serum CA199
levels with statistical significance based on the -Log10p values. Unexpectedly,
patients suffering from gout and anemia had significantly low CA199 levels
compared to that of the healthy controls. These results showed that serum CA199
levels are not only increased in pancreatic and other cancer patients but also
either increased or decreased in noncancer diseases. The overall data indicated
that the abnormal serum CA199 level might be an indicator of system malfunction
rather than a cancer biomarker in general.

Most of clinically used cancer biomarkers are either specific glycan structures
or glycoproteins. Although the high serum levels of the cancer biomarkers are
also present in certain patients suffering noncancer diseases, systematic
measurement and comparison of the serum levels of all cancer biomarkers among
cancer and noncancer patients have not been reported. In this study, the serum
levels of 17 glucose and glycan-related biomarkers including 10 cancer biomarkers
SCCA, CA724, CA50, CA242, CA125, CA199, CA153, AFP, CEA, and PSA were
retrospectively investigated based on clinical laboratory data in two medical
centers during the past 6 years (2012-2018). The data included a total of
1,477,309 clinical lab test results of 17 biomarkers from healthy controls and
patients suffering 64 different types of cancer and noncancer diseases. We found 
that the median serum levels of CA724, CEA, CA153, SCCA, and CA125 were highest
not in cancer patients but in patients suffering gout, lung fibrosis, nephrotic
syndrome, uremia, and cirrhosis, respectively. Consistently, the classical
ovarian cancer biomarker CA125 had better overall sensitivity and specificity as 
biomarker for cirrhosis (67% and 92%, respectively) than that for ovarian cancer 
(41% and 97%, respectively). Furthermore, the information shown as heatmap or
waterfall built on the -Log10p values of the 17 glycan-related biomarkers in
different clinically defined diseases suggested that all glycan-related
biomarkers had cancer-, aging-, and disease-relevant characteristics and cancers 
were systems disease. The detailed presentation of the data for each of the 17
biomarkers will be deliberated in chapters 6-23 in this book series.

Wide use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as white pigments induces
unintentionally release in environment which increases concerns about their
adverse health effects on respiratory system. So it is crucial to get a deep
understanding of the disease process and molecular mechanism. Epigenetic
mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have been found to play a role in the
development of lung diseases by affecting expression of key genes. In addition,
there could be potential different toxic effects of TiO2 NPs between young and
adult. Thus, the comparative toxicity of TiO2 NPs in 5-week (young) and 10-week
(adult) old NIH mice is investigated in this study following nasal inhalation of 
TiO2 NPs at dose of 20 mg/kg (body weight)/day for 30 days. Global DNA
methylation and hydroxymethylation in lung were measured. Promoter methylation of
inflammatory genes (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and tissue fibrosis gene (Thy-1) were
determined. Additional, RNA-sequencing runs were performed on the pulmonic
libraries. We found the induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were more
severe in young mice. Decreased global methylation and hydroxymethylation were
only found in the young group. The altered methylation in promoter of TNF-α and
Thy-1 were found to play a role in the inflammatory response and fibration.
RNA-sequencing showed that in pathways in cancer expression of 197 genes was
up-regulated in the young mice more that in the adult mice. All these results
suggested that the young ages are more sensitive to TiO2 NP exposure and the
potential of abnormal DNA methylation might be used as biomarkers of both
exposure and disease development.

Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a major antioxidant enzyme in plasma, catalyzes 
the reduction of H2O2, lipid peroxides and organic hydroperoxides by reducing
glutathione (GSH). Hypermethylation of the GPx3 promoter and suppression of GPx3 
expression are associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, and response to
chemotherapy in various types of cancer. We previously reported the possibility
of GPx3 as a serological marker for lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the
role of the microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-921 (miR-921) in the regulation of GPx3
expression in A549 lung cancer cells. The expression patterns of the miRNAs of
A549, H1650, and H1975 cells were compared and analyzed. Of 25 miRNAs from the
A549 cell line, the expression of 10 decreased and the expression of 15 increased
in comparison to the miRNAs from the other cell lines. Of the miRNAs with reduced
expression, the most reduced miRNA was miR-921 and the expected binding site of
which is in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GPx3. We found that miR-921
inhibited the expression of GPx3 and bound directly to the 3'-UTR of GPx3.

An increasing number of microRNA (miRNA) have been demonstrated to serve as
molecular biomarkers for tumor cell progression. miR‑512‑5p was revealed as
oncogenic regulator in several types of cancer. However, whether and how
miR‑512‑5p regulates non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the
present study, the expression of miR‑512‑5p was detected in NSCLC tissues and
cell lines. Then, the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in NSCLC
A549 and H1299 cell lines were detected when miR‑512‑5p was overexpressed.
Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was identified. The level of miR‑512‑5p was
decreased in NSCLC tissues and in NSCLC cells compared with adjacent normal
tissues and normal lung tissue cell lines. miR‑512‑5p mimics inhibited the cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis in A549 and H1299 cells.
In addition, a luciferase reporter assay suggested that overexpression of
miR‑512‑5p may decrease the expression of the E26 transformation
specific‑1 (ETS1) gene; it was subsequently verified that downregulation of the
ETS1 gene inhibited cell proliferation and migration and induced cell apoptosis
in A549 and H1299 cells, and ETS1 small interfering RNA in the presence of an
miR‑512‑5p inhibitor reversed the effect. The data described in the present study
suggest that miR‑512‑5p may be a tumor suppressor and a potential treatment
target in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have become a potential diagnostic
tumor marker and have the potential for wide clinical applications. However, the 
diagnostic parameters vary among previous studies. A systematic review of the
literature and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic value of
CTCs for lung cancer.
METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and
Embase databases. The included studies assessed the diagnostic value of CTCs in
patients with lung cancer up to September 30, 2018. A total of 1601 patients in 8
studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated the pooled sensitivity,
specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR),
diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) to investigate the
diagnostic value of CTCs for lung cancer. STATA version 12.0 and Meta-DiSc
version 1.4 software were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73-0.78), the specificity was
0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), the PLR was 6.29 (95% CI: 3.98-9.96), and the NLR was
0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.42). Furthermore, the pooled DOR of CTCs for lung cancer was
27.73 (95% CI: 12.99-59.23). The summarized area under the ROC curve was 0.93
(95% CI: 0.90-0.95). The meta-regression analysis suggested that the
heterogeneity was mainly attributed to the experimental methods. The results of
the clinical diagnosis efficiency show that the diagnostic efficiency has
increased significantly by testing CTCs for diagnosing lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CTCs are associated
with a high diagnostic value for lung cancer. These findings require large-scale 
prospective studies to verify and evaluate the diagnostic value in the future.

OBJECTIVES: Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1) is a cancer/testis
antigen reactivated in several human malignancies. So far, the major focus of
studies on KK-LC-1 has been on its potential as diagnostic biomarker and
immunotherapy target. However, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms 
in cancer progression remain unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of KK-LC-1 in HCC was analysed using RT-qPCR,
Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The roles of KK-LC-1 on HCC progression
were examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Pathway
inhibitor DAPT was employed to confirm the regulatory effect of KK-LC-1 on the
downstream Notch signalling. The interaction of KK-LC-1 with presenilin-1 was
determined by co-immunoprecipitation. The association of CpG island methylation
status with KK-LC-1 reactivation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR,
bisulphite sequencing PCR and 5-Aza-dC treatment.
RESULTS: We identified that HCC tissues exhibited increased levels of KK-LC-1.
High KK-LC-1 level independently predicted poor survival outcome. KK-LC-1
promoted cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
in vitro and in vivo. KK-LC-1 modulated the Notch1/Hes1 pathway to exacerbate HCC
progression through physically interacting with presenilin-1. Upregulation of
KK-LC-1 in HCC was attributed to hypomethylated CpG islands.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that hypomethylation-induced KK-LC-1
overexpression played an important role in HCC progression and independently
predicted poor survival. We defined the KK-LC-1/presenilin-1/Notch1/Hes1 as a
novel signalling pathway that was involved in the growth and metastasis of HCC.

INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded one of the major breakthroughs in cancer 
treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the
quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are
related to and may therefore act as non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for
immunotherapy response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic
lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We performed a AI-based characterization of 
each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and 
validate a non-invasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing
between immunotherapy responding and non-responding. To define the biological
basis of the radiographic biomarker, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis in
an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients.
RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to
0.83 AUC, p < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64
AUC, p = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level,
immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both
cancer types (p < 0.001), resulting in a one year survival difference of 24%
(p = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in
mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and 
preferential response to immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions 
on standard-of-care imaging may function as non-invasive biomarkers for response 
to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in
both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.

BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations across
multiple cancers can reveal shared biologic pathways. Prior pleiotropic studies
have primarily focused on European-descent individuals. Yet population-specific
genetic variation can occur, and potential pleiotropic associations among diverse
racial/ethnic populations could be missed. We examined cross-cancer pleiotropic
associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans.
METHODS: We conducted a pleiotropic analysis among 1,410 African American lung
cancer cases and 2,843 controls. We examined 36,958 variants previously
associated (or in linkage disequilibrium) with cancer in prior genome-wide
association studies. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for
age, sex, global ancestry, study site, and smoking status.
RESULTS: We identified three novel genomic regions significantly associated
(FDR-corrected P <0.10) with lung cancer risk (rs336958 on 5q14.3, rs7186207 on
16q22.2, and rs11658063 on 17q12). On chromosome16q22.2, rs7186207 was
significantly associated with reduced risk [OR = 0.43; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 0.73-0.89], and functional annotation using GTEx showed rs7186207 modifies 
DHODH gene expression. The minor allele at rs336958 on 5q14.3 was associated with
increased lung cancer risk (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.78), whereas the minor
allele at rs11658063 on 17q12 was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.80; 95%
CI, 0.72-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel associations on chromosomes 5q14.3, 16q22.2, and
17q12, which contain HNF1B, DHODH, and HAPLN1 genes, respectively. SNPs within
these regions have been previously associated with multiple cancers. This is the 
first study to examine cross-cancer pleiotropic associations for lung cancer in
African Americans.
IMPACT: Our findings demonstrate novel cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with
lung cancer risk in African Americans.

The incidence of nonsmoking female patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) has increased in recent decades; however, the pathogenesis of patients is
unclear, and early diagnosis biomarkers are in urgent need. In this study, 136
nonsmoking female subjects (65 patients with NSCLC, 6 patients with benign lung
tumors, and 65 healthy controls) were enrolled, and their metabolic profiling was
investigated by using pseudotargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A
total of 56 annotated metabolites were found and verified to be significantly
different in nonsmoking females with NSCLC compared with the control. The
metabolic profiling was featured by disturbed energy metabolism, amino acid
metabolism, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and so on. Cysteine, serine, and 
1-monooleoylglycerol were defined as the biomarker panel for the diagnosis of
NSCLC patients. 98.5 and 91.4% of subjects were correctly distinguished in the
discovery and validation sets, respectively. The biomarker panel was also useful 
for the diagnosis of in situ malignancy patients, with an accuracy of 97.7 and
97.8% in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. The study provides a
biomarker panel for the auxiliary diagnosis of nonsmoking females with NSCLC.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression patterns of transcription factor SOX12 in
lung adenocarcinoma and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the
malignancy.
METHODS: Large cancer genome databases were used to analyze SOX12 expression
level in lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semiquantitative PCR
were used to detect the expression of SOX12 in 36 specimens of lung
adenocarcinoma tissues, 15 adjacent tissues and 21 normal lung tissues. The
prognostic value of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the relationship between
SOX12 expression and the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival
(PPS) of the patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Analysis of TCGA database and GEO (GSE40419) database showed that SOX12 
expression levels were significantly higher in in lung adenocarcinoma than in
normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). The results of IHC and semiquantitative PCR
revealed that SOX12 was expressed at significantly higher levels in lung
adenocarcinoma than in normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis showed that patients with lung adenocarcinoma positive for SOX12 had a
significantly shorter OS and PPS time than those negative for SOX12 (P &lt;
0.05), but SOX12 positivity did not significantly affect OS and PPS of patients
with lung squamous cell carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: High expression levels of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma are
significantly associated with a poor OS of the patients, suggesting the value of 
SOX12 to assist in early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of lung
adenocarcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), tumour biopsy can often be an
invasive procedure. The development of a non-invasive methodology to study
genetic changes via circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is an appealing concept.
Whilst CTCs typically remain as rare cells, improvements in epitope-independent
CTC isolation techniques has given rise to a greater capture of CTCs. In this
cross sectional study, we demonstrate the capture and characterization of NSCLC
CTCs for the clinically actionable markers epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) alterations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and
programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. The study identified CTCs/CTC
clusters in 26/35 Stage IV NSCLC patients, and subsequently characterized the
CTCs for EGFR mutation, ALK status and PD-L1 status. This pilot study
demonstrates the potential of a non-invasive fluid biopsy to determine clinically
relevant biomarkers in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of degrading and
modifying most components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basal
membrane (BM), and play crucial roles in cancer invasion and metastasis. MMP gene
expressions were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, which was
associated with tumor spread and patient prognosis. Polymorphisms in MMPs have
been reported to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study aim to evaluate the serum levels and polymorphisms of
MMP-9 and MMP-13 in non-small cell lung cancer patients compared to normal
subjects and their correlation to non-small cell lung cancer histopathology
findings in Southern Chinese people.
METHODS: This case⁻control study included 245 patients with NSCLC and 258 healthy
controls. Genomic DNA was extracted by using DNA extraction kit, genotyping was
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) and direct DNA sequencing, and serum levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 were
measured by using a specific ELISA, Human Matrix Metalloproteinase Enzyme
Immunoassay Kits. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 23.0
software package.
RESULTS: The subjects carrying the TT genotype had a decreased risk of lung
cancer in MMP9-1562C/T comparing with the CC genotype (p = 0.00, OR = 0.45, 95%
CI = 0.29⁻0.68), and the MMP13-77 AA genotype was associated with a decreased
risk of NSCLC by comparing with the GG genotype (p = 0.03, OR = 0.56, 95% CI =
0.33⁻0.94). Moreover, the C allele of MMP9-1562C/T could increase serum level of 
NSCLC in compared with the A allele (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.75⁻1.89). Similarly,
the AA genotype of MMP13 might be a marker of decreased serum level of lung
cancer (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.51⁻1.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses underline the support of the notion
that the CC genotype of MMP9-1562C/T and GG genotypes of MMP13-77G/A were
associated with the increased risk NSCLC, and the serum levels of MMP9 and MMP13 
were consistent with the results of the SNP analysis. MMP13 and MMP9 might be
function as a key oncogene in NSCLC with a Southern Chinese population. Combined 
detection of SNP and enzyme activity between MMP9 and MMP13 are expected to be a 
potential diagnostic method of non-small cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear why radiation clinically provides a synergistic
effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The
purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic
efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT)
in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were
administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided
into RT and non-RT groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the 
initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were
treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range:
1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of
nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was
significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients
who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was
particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%,
and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Previous RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable
prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to
nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic 
effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the
outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.

The respiratory epithelium arises from alveolar epithelial progenitors which
differentiate into alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. AT2
cells are stem cells in the lung critical for the repair process after injury.
Mechanisms regulating AT1 and AT2 cell maturation are poorly defined. We report
that the activation of the glucocorticoid pathway in an in vitro alveolar
epithelial lineage differentiation assay led to increased AT2 marker Sftpc and
decreased miR-142 expression. Using miR-142 KO mice, we demonstrate an increase
in the AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Overexpression of miR-142 in alveolar
progenitor cells in vivo led to the opposite effect. Examination of the KO lungs 
at E18.5 revealed enhanced expression of miR-142 targets Apc, Ep300 and Kras
associated with increased β-catenin and p-Erk signaling. Silencing of miR-142
expression in lung explants grown in vitro triggers enhanced Sftpc expression as 
well as increased AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Pharmacological inhibition of
Ep300-β-catenin but not Erk in vitro prevented the increase in Sftpc expression
triggered by loss of miR-142. These results suggest that the
glucocorticoid-miR-142-Ep300-β-catenin signaling axis controls pneumocyte
maturation.

INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway deregulation
promotes the acquisition of stemlike properties in non-small-cell lung cancer.
EGFR inhibition through NOTCH enriches lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Src through
Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activates NOTCH. Signal transduction and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurs upon EGFR blockade and
regulates the generation of CSCs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Aldefluor assay kit, we investigated the
enrichment of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells in
EGFR-mutation-positive cells treated with gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib.
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in CSC marker expression 
upon EGFR blockade. We performed gene expression analysis in a cohort of
EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. We evaluated the
association of gene expression with treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: The cell subpopulation surviving EGFR inhibition had high ALDH activity 
and elevated CSC marker expression. Concurrent inhibition of EGFR, STAT3, and Src
diminished the CSC subpopulation in an EGFR-mutation-positive cellular model. In 
a cohort of 64 EGFR-mutation-positive patients, 2 ALDH1 isoforms and the NOTCH
target hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), when highly expressed, were
predictive of worse outcome to EGFR blockade. The gene expression of
B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) that
maintains the self-renewal of stem cells was also related to treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION: Single EGFR inhibitors increase the population of CSCs. Combinatory
therapy targeting STAT3 and Src may be of potential benefit. ALDH1, HES1, and
Bmi-1 are essential biomarkers in the initial assessment of
EGFR-mutation-positive patients.

BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) developed during immunotherapy 
with anti-PD-1 agents, could be a predictive surrogate marker of clinical benefit
in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Patients with NSCLC, treated with anti-PD-1 agents, were retrospectively
evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the
relationships between types of irAEs (differentiated according to system/organ
involved and to single-site/multiple-site), overall response rate (ORR),
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We further performed a
6-week landmark analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 559 patients were enrolled; 231 patients (41.3%) developed
irAEs of any grade and 50 patients (8.9%) G3/G4 events; 191 of them (82.6%)
developed "single-site" irAEs and 40 (17.4%) "multiple-site" irAEs. At
multivariate analysis, higher ORR was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), 
"single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine (P = .0043) and skin irAEs (P =
.0005). Longer PFS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), "single-site"
irAEs (P < .0001), "multiple-site" irAEs (P = .0374), endocrine irAEs (P = .0084)
and skin irAEs (P = .0001). Longer OS was related to irAEs of any grade (P <
.0001), "single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0044),
gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0437), skin irAEs (P = .0006), and others irAEs (P =
.0378). At the 6-week landmark analysis, irAEs of any grade was confirmed an
independent predictor of higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that irAEs are concordantly related to higher
ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with
NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need to explore the predictive biomarkers of
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, 
we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitors.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association
between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in
NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of 
treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1.
RESULTS: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results
suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS
(HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and
prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most
subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1
expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study
quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated
NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P =  0.036) but not for PFS benefit 
(r = 0.198, P =  0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with 
HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P =  0.041).
CONCLUSION: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC
patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive 
and prognostic value in this clinical scenario.

OBJECTIVES: A number of key immune regulators show prognostic value in malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the association between Bridging integrator 1
(BIN1), indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and patient outcome has not been
investigated. We aimed to determine the expression of BIN1 and IDO1, their
association with other markers and impact on overall survival (OS) in MPM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of BIN1, IDO1, CD3, CD20 and CD68 were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 67 patients who underwent
pleurectomy/decortication. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan
Meier method and significant biomarkers were entered into a Cox Regression
multivariate model, accounting for known prognostic factors such as age, gender, 
histological subtype, PD-L1 expression and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.
RESULTS: Immune markers were variably expressed in tumor cells, ranging from 0%
to 100% for BIN1 (median: 89%), and 0% to 77.5% for IDO1 (median: 0%). Expression
of markers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and macrophages ranged from
0% to more than 50%. BIN1 expression was high in 35 patients (51%) and was
associated with increased OS (median: 12 vs 6 months for high and low BIN1
respectively,p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed BIN1 remained an independent
prognostic indicator (HR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.82, p = 0.01). The majority of
patients had immune inflamed tumors (77%) and there was a significant association
between TILs and BIN1 (p = 0 < 0.01), PD-L1 (p=0.04) and CD68+ macrophages in the
tumor (p < 0.01). There were no significant associations between PD-L1 and BIN1
or IDO1.
CONCLUSION: High BIN1 expression is a favorable prognostic biomarker and is
associated with TILs in MPM.

OBJECTIVES: The biomarkers cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) and human
epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are useful in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their combination has not been
investigated yet. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the ability of
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 to predict recurrence as part of follow-up monitoring in
patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from patients with stage
I-IIIA ADC preoperatively and during follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and
then every 6-12 months up to 5 years post-R0 resection. Samples were analyzed for
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 via electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. All cases of disease
recurrence were verified by imaging. The diagnostic performance of CYFRA 21-1,
HE4, and their combination to predict recurrence was assessed by Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) and corresponding area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: 115 patients with ADC were included (N = 612 biomarker measurements);
median age was 63 years; most had stage I-II disease (n = 97; 84.3%). All
patients underwent surgical resection; 44 patients (38%) also received adjuvant
chemotherapy and 16 (14%) received radiation therapy. At the median timepoint for
the last blood sample collection (37 months), 31 patients (27%) had experienced
recurrence. Both CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 were able to detect recurrence (AUC and 95%
confidence interval [CI]): 75.9% (66.0-85.8%) and 75.4% (65.9-84.8%),
respectively, but this increased with the combination (78.8% [69.0-88.6%]). At a 
sensitivity of 80%, the respective specificities (95% CI) for CYFRA 21-1, HE4,
and the combination were 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), and 69.7%
(65.8-73.4%).
CONCLUSION: Serial measurements of serum CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 levels could provide 
a valuable method for follow-up monitoring of patients with ADC to detect
recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to cancer
progression, and several inflammatory markers have been reported to be associated
with the clinical outcomes in patients with various types of cancer. Recently,
the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) has been developed as a
prognostic marker in patients with lung cancer. The difference between the ALI
and the inflammatory markers reported in the previous studies is that the ALI
contains not only indices related to inflammation but also the body mass index
(BMI), which was reported to correlate with the sarcopenic status. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the ALI in patients
with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 159 patients who underwent
combination chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer between
2008 and 2016. The BMI was calculated by dividing the weight by height squared.
The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated from a blood sample by
dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. The ALI 
was defined as follows: ALI=BMI × serum albumin concentration/NLR.
RESULTS: The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the low-ALI group
than in the high-ALI group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the ALI was an independent 
prognostic factor for the overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.773, 95% confidence
interval: 1.773-4.335, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A newly developed prognostic marker, the ALI, was found to be a
novel prognostic marker in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal
cancer as well as in patients with lung cancer.

Background: Lung cancer is the most common and lethal malignancy worldwide. TCTP 
is highly expressed in various cancers including lung cancer.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) could increase cancer cell invasion.
Whether TCTP's expression is associated with EMT in lung adenocarcinoma is
largely unknown.
Methods: Several Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to analyze the
correlation between TCTP expression and overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma
patients by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Then, 24 surgically removed fresh
lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples and paired paracancer tissue samples were used
to analyze the correlation between TCTP expression and tumor stage by
immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, stable cell lines were generated using
lentiviral transduction systems to knock down or overexpress TCTP in A549 cells. 
Cell migration and invasion were measured by scratch and transwell assays, and
EMT marker proteins such as α-SMA, ZEB1, and E-cadherin were quantitated by
Western blot. The expression levels of miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429 were
determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and their target genes were predicted
by an online database miRTarBase. The interaction between TCTP and these genes
was analyzed by String database and visualized by Cytoscape.
Results: TCTP was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to paracancer
tissues. The expression of TCTP was associated with shorter overall survival.
TCTP knockdown experiment in A549 cells suggested that TCTP knockdown could
decrease the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, and the expression
level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but increase the expression of E-cadherin and p53. Vice 
versa, overexpression of TCTP could increase the migration and invasion of cancer
cells, and the expression level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but decrease the expression of
E-cadherin and p53. Furthermore, we found the expression of miR-200a, miR-141,
and miR-429 was associated with TCTP expression.
Conclusion: TCTP promotes EMT in lung adenocarcinoma, and this effect may be
associated with miR-200 family members like miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary parenchymal destruction is consequence of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which results in degradation of the
extracellular matrix and the appearance of peripheral pulmonary cells. The aim of
this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the detection and isolation of
Circulating Pulmonary Cells (CPCs) in peripheral blood of patients with COPD.
METHODS: 17 COPD patients were enrolled in this prospective study to isolate
CPCs. Peripheral blood samples for CPC analysis were processed using positive
immunomagnetic methods combined with a double immunocytochemistry. Two
antibodies, anti-cytokeratin and anti-CD44v6 were used to confirm the epithelial 
nature of the isolated cells and their lung origin respectively.
RESULTS: CK/CD44v6 positive CPCs were identified in 6 of 17 COPD patients (35.2% 
of the total) (range: 1-2 cells). No CPCs were detected in any of the 10 healthy 
volunteers. The COPD CPCs + patients showed a trend towards greater severity of
the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest the feasibility to detect CPCs in peripheral
blood of patients with COPD and its potential use as prognostic marker.

The antitumor activity of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif protein inhibitors
(BETi) has been demonstrated across numerous types of cancer. As such, these
inhibitors are currently undergoing widespread clinical evaluation. However,
predictive biomarkers allowing the stratification of tumors into responders and
non-responders to BETi are lacking. Here we showed significant anti-proliferative
effects of low dosage BETi in vitro and in vivo against aggressive ovarian and
lung cancer models lacking SMARCA4 and SMARCA2, key components of SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complexes. Restoration of SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 promoted
resistance to BETi in these models, and conversely, knockdown of SMARCA4
sensitized resistant cells to BETi. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that
exposure to BETi potently downregulated a network of genes involved in receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells, including the
oncogenic RTK HER3. Repression of signaling downstream of HER3 was found to be an
important determinant of response to BETi in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells. Overall,
we propose that BETi represent a rational therapeutic strategy in poor prognosis,
SMARCA4/A2-deficient cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer immunotherapy represents a major therapeutic breakthrough.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in the context of a combination are
considered the new standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Areas covered: This review explains the biologic rationale behind the
implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the therapy of advanced NSCLC.
It provides a detailed description of the clinical trials that have studied the
various agents now in use and the results that lead to the currently approved
indications. It also explores the area of established and developing biomarkers, 
and the trends of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities
(chemotherapy, antiangiogenic agents, radiotherapy), or with other immune
modulators. Expert opinion: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been established as
the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. They can be
administered according to PD-L1 expression upfront as monotherapy or in
combination with chemotherapy- regardless of PD-L1 status - or in the later lines
of therapy. They also represent a less toxic and more effective treatment choice 
than chemotherapy alone. The development of reliable biomarkers for patient
selection and the subsequent use of the appropriate immune-based approach for
each patient will define the role of immunotherapy in the years to come.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore biological functions of differentially expressed 
miRNAs during carcinogenesis, to identify miRNAs dysegulations involved in DNA
repair mechanisms, and to evaluate potential of miRNAs as prognostic and
diagnostic biomarkers for early lung adenocarcinomas (LAC).
METHODS: We obtained 21 LAC and paired adjacent normal formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded lung tissues from patients who underwent curative resection for
stage I LAC. We compared expression levels of eight miRNAs involved in DNA repair
mechanism between LAC and adjacent tissues.
RESULTS: Expressions of Hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p,
hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-let-7a-5p were significantly
up-regulated in stage I LAC tissues compared with those in adjacent tissues. In
addition, expressions of hsa-mir-9-5p, hsa-mir-24-3p, hsa-mir-125a-3p,
hsa-mir-125b-5p, and hsa-mir-155-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage Ia
LAC tissues, whereas expressions of hsa-mir-125a-3p and hsa-mir-125b-5p were
significantly up-regulated in stage Ib LAC tissues. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that AUROC of hsa-mir-125b-5p was 0.875 (P
< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Expression of hsa-mir-125b-5p could be used to distinguish LAC from
adjacent tissues. Our result suggests that hsa-mir125b-5p can be a prognostic and
diagnostic biomarker for LAC.

As a noninvasive blood testing, the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
methylation in plasma has raised an increasing interest due to diagnostic
applications. Although extensively used in cfDNA methylation analysis, bisulfite 
sequencing is less cost-effective. In this study, we investigated the cfDNA
methylation patterns in lung cancer patients by MeDIP-seq. Compared with the
healthy individuals, 330 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at gene
promoters were identified in lung cancer patients with 33 hypermethylated and 297
hypomethylated regions, respectively. Moreover, these hypermethylated genes were 
validated with the publicly available DNA methylation data, yielding a set of ten
significant differentially methylated genes in lung cancer, including B3GAT2,
BCAR1, HLF, HOPX, HOXD11, MIR1203, MYL9, SLC9A3R2, SYT5, and VTRNA1-3. Our study 
demonstrated MeDIP-seq could be effectively used for cfDNA methylation profiling 
and identified a set of potential biomarker genes with clinical application for
lung cancer.

Diagnostic value of microRNA (miR)-197 and miR-145 in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and their relationship with the clinicopathological parameters of NSCLC
patients were investigated. Seventy-six patients with NSCLC admitted to Jimo
Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2016 to March 2018 were
enrolled in group A, while 60 healthy who received health examinations during the
same period were enrolled in group B. The relative expression levels of serum
miR-197 and miR-145 were detected by RT-qPCR. The relative expression of serum
miR-197 in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (P<0.001); the
relative expression of serum miR-145 in group A was significantly lower than that
in group B (P<0.001); serum miR-197 in group A showed association with the
clinical stage of NSCLC patients (P<0.001); serum miR-145 in group A was
associated with the clinical stage and pathological differentiation of patients
with NSCLC (P<0.001). The AUC of serum miR-197 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.864 (95% 
CI: 0.804-0.924), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.68% and a specificity of
85.00%; the AUC of serum miR-145 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.879 (95% CI:
0.824-0.934), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.21% and a specificity of
71.67%; the AUC of the diagnosis of the combination of serum miR-197 and miR-145 
for NSCLC was 0.952 (95% CI: 0.919-0.984), with a diagnostic sensitivity of
92.10% and a specificity of 78.33%. miR-197 and miR-145 are potential new
biomarkers in the diagnosis of NSCLC due to their possible involvement in the
occurrence and development of NSCLC. With good sensitivity and specificity of
single miR-197 and single miR-145 for the diagnosis of NSCLC, the combined
detection of miR-197 and miR-145 can achieve a better sensitivity in the
diagnosis of NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a potential
biomarker predicting response to anti-programmed cell death-1 protein receptor
(PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 protein ligand (PD-L1) therapy, but few studies
have explored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) TMB in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with NSCLC with ctDNA testing were
retrospectively evaluated from a single institution, along with a validation
cohort from a second institution. ctDNA TMB was derived using the number of
detected mutations over the DNA sequencing length.
RESULTS: Higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with smoking history
(p < .05, chi-squared test). Among patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors (n = 20), higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with shorter
progressive free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 45 vs. 355 days; hazard
ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-24.6; p < .01, and OS 106 days
vs. not reached; HR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.3-27.1; p < .01, respectively). In a small
independent validation cohort (n = 12), there was a nonsignificant numerical
difference for higher ctDNA TMB predicting shorter OS but not PFS. ctDNA TMB was 
not correlated with RECIST tumor burden estimation in the subset of patients
treated with immune checkpoint blockade.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that higher ctDNA TMB, at the current
commercial sequencing length, reflects worse clinical outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Biomarkers to identify patients who will respond to
immune checkpoint blockade are critical. Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has
emerged as a viable biomarker to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, but
few studies have explored the meaning and potential clinical significance of
noninvasive, blood-based TMB. Here, we investigated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
TMB and present data demonstrating that current ctDNA TMB may reflect tumor
burden and that ctDNA panels with a greater number of mutations may be necessary 
to more accurately reflect tissue TMB.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of lung cancer mortality. Bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a component of the cancer
microenvironment and contribute to cancer progression. Intratumoral hypoxia
affects both cancer and stromal cells. Exosomes are recognized as mediators of
intercellular communication. Here, we aim to further elucidate the communication 
between BMSC-derived exosomes and cancer cells in the hypoxic niche.
METHODS: Exosomal miRNA profiling was performed using a microRNA array. Lung
cancer cells and an in vivo mouse syngeneic tumor model were used to evaluate the
effects of select exosomal microRNAs. Hypoxic BMSC-derived plasma exosomal miRNAs
were assessed for their capacity to discriminate between cancer patients and
non-cancerous controls and between cancer patients with or without metastasis.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that exosomes derived from hypoxic BMSCs are taken by
neighboring cancer cells and promote cancer cell invasion and EMT.
Exosome-mediated transfer of select microRNAs, including miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p 
and miR-5100, from BMSCs to epithelial cancer cells activates STAT3 signaling and
increases the expression of mesenchymal related molecules. The diagnostic
accuracy of individual microRNA showed that plasma exosomal miR-193a-3p can
discriminate cancer patients from non-cancerous controls. A panel of these three 
plasma exosomal microRNAs showed a better diagnostic accuracy to discriminate
lung cancer patients with or without metastasis than individual exosomal
microRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100,
could promote invasion of lung cancer cells by activating STAT3
signalling-induced EMT. These exosomal miRNAs may be promising noninvasive
biomarkers for cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the most frequent type of lung 
cancer is associated with extensive mortality. Researchers have studied the
suitability of several molecules as biomarkers for early detection of this
cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as the main regulators of gene expression 
have also been assessed in this regard.
METHODS: In the present study, we compared expression level of Fas-antisense 1
(FAS-AS1), Growth Arrest Specific 5 (GAS5), PVT1, Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly
Transcript 1 (NEAT1), HOXA transcript antisense RNA myeloid-specific 1
(HOTAIRM1), taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) and TNFα and hnRNPL related
immunoregulatory LincRNA (THRIL) in 32 NSCLC samples and their corresponding
adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs).
RESULTS: NEAT1 has been significantly over-expressed in NSCLC tissues obtained
from male subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (Relative expression
(REx) = 3.022, P = 0.019) but not in female subjects (P = 0.975). FAS-AS1 was
significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues obtained from both males and
females subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (REx = - 4.12 and - 3.14, 
P = 0.015 and 0.033 respectively). TUG1, GAS5, THRIL and HOTAIRM1 were
significantly down-regulated in tumoral tissues obtained from male subjects
compared with the corresponding ANCTs.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed dysregulation of these lncRNAs in NSCLC tissues
compared with the corresponding ANCTs warrants future studies to confirm the
results of the current study in larger sample sizes to elaborate their role as
cancer biomarkers.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LA) is the most commonly occurring histological type of
non‑small cell lung cancer. Diagnosis and treatment of LA remain a major clinical
challenge. In the present study, to identify early LA biomarkers, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) were separated from the plasma samples from 153 patients with LA
and 75 healthy controls. microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling was performed at
the screening stage (5 patients with LA vs. 5 controls), followed by verification
at the validation stage (40 patients with LA vs. 20 controls) using reverse
transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The four
disordered miRNAs (miR‑505‑5p, miR‑486‑3p, miR‑486‑3p and miR‑382‑3p) identified 
in the plasma EVs were further evaluated at the testing stage (108 patients with 
LA vs. 50 controls) by RT‑qPCR. It was revealed that miR‑505‑5p was upregulated, 
whereas miR‑382‑3p was downregulated, in the EVs from patients with LA.
Furthermore, miR‑505‑5p was also upregulated in tumor tissues, compared with
adjacent non‑tumor control tissues. Subsequently, the direct targets of
miR‑505‑5p were predicted using bioinformatics analyses, and verified by
luciferase assay and immunoblotting. The present study determined that miR‑505‑5p
functions as an oncogene, promoting lung cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting
cancer cell apoptosis via the targeting of tumor protein P53‑regulated
apoptosis‑inducing protein 1 (TP53AIP1). Finally, it was confirmed that
miR‑505‑5p in plasma EVs could be delivered to lung cancer cells, inhibiting cell
apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation by targeting TP53AIP1. In conclusion, 
the present study indicated that miRNA‑505‑5p functions as an oncogene that may
be used as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of LA.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: We determined the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of 
long-term response to pemetrexed maintenance therapy as first-line treatment for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A total of 950 advanced NSCLC patients received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 ) 
plus cisplatin (60 mg/m2 ) (Pem-Cis) induction chemotherapy every three weeks as 
first-line treatment between January 2010 and August 2018. Patients who did not
show progression after four cycles of Pem-Cis and received at least one cycle of 
pemetrexed maintenance were recruited (n = 199).
RESULTS: Patients were divided into subgroups according to total cycles of
pemetrexed: ≤ 10 (F10, n = 134) and > 10 (M10, n = 65). The M10 group had a
higher proportion of patients with stage M1a (intrathoracic metastasis alone) and
exhibited lower levels of thymidylate synthase (TS) than the F10 group (median
H-score 10.0% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.031). Further subgrouping identified extreme
responders: ≤ 7 (F7, n = 101) and ≥ 20 (M20, n = 26) cycles. The M20 group showed
lower mean serum CEA levels before (17.5 vs. 147.0; P = 0.099) and after (6.9 vs.
53.2; P = 0.001) Pem-Cis treatment, and a higher incidence of normalization after
Pem-Cis (abnormal 41.7% vs. 68.5%; P = 0.015). M1a stage, normalization of CEA
levels after Pem-Cis, and lower TS H-score were predictors of progression-free
survival in patients administered pemetrexed maintenance.
CONCLUSION: M1a stage and lower TS expression were predictors of long-term
response to pemetrexed maintenance. CEA normalization after Pem-Cis could be an
additional surrogate marker of positive response to long-term treatment.

Novel molecular targets and promising targeted therapies have reshaped
diagnostics in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite
this progress, the implementation of molecular screening to identify predictive
biomarkers in Indian clinical and pathology settings has been challenging due to 
operational and logistical constraints. This consensus guideline brings together 
medical oncologists, molecular pathologists and pathologists from India to
provide a quick and competent reference for biomarker testing in NSCLC. The
guideline summarizes the importance of targetable mutations in NSCLC such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma
kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by ROS-1 gene, overexpression of
programmed cell death ligand-1 and resistant EGFR mutations. It reaffirms
recommendations from international working groups, discusses vulnerable
pre-analytical procedures and provides a balanced review on the pros and cons of 
different diagnostic tests (immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, polymerase chain reaction-based testing and next-generation
sequencing). The document also provides an algorithm to aid diagnostic
decision-making and a checklist to assess the quality of testing laboratories
that will help the medical oncologists make an informed choice. Overall, these
recommendations are based on evidence and clinical experience and will aid
policymakers, oncologists, health care practitioners and pathologists who strive 
to implement molecular strategies and make informed decisions for improved care
in NSCLC in India.Funding: AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited.

Development of treatment options for Chinese patients with advanced squamous cell
lung cancer: focus on afatinib.

University, Shanghai 200030, China, shun_lu@hotmail.com.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China, and approximately one 
third of these cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung. Ethnic
diversity and country-specific environmental factors can account for
interindividual variations in response to and tolerability of anticancer
therapies. Although several targeted therapies have recently been approved for
patients with relapsed/refractory SqCC of the lung, only afatinib, an
irreversible ErbB family blocker, has data of Chinese patients. In the Phase III 
LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit vs the
reversible first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in both the 
overall population and the Chinese subset, with a manageable safety profile.
Emerging biomarker data from LUX-Lung 8 suggest that patients with ErbB
mutations, especially ErbB2, and those classified as "good" in the VeriStrat®
proteomic test, may benefit from afatinib treatment in particular, regardless of 
ethnicity, and may get a long-term response. In conclusion, afatinib is a valid
second-line option for Chinese patients with SqCC of the lung, and specific
biomarkers may help guide in treatment decision-making. Ongoing studies will
provide further guidance on afatinib's place in the treatment algorithm,
alongside the other novel targeted therapies.

To summarize the therapeutic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting, we attempted
to identify potential molecular biomarkers or clinical factors that reflected the
therapeutic effect. The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the
outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until
May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint
and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease
control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy
was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and
we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank
test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24
patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had 
died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line
treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line
treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line
treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). 
Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%).
Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%.
The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach
the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced
non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical
trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 
70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years
old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive
more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential
patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on
brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1
intracranial efficacy.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a master regulator of mitosis and the DNA damage
response, is considered to be an intriguing target in the research field of
mitotic intervention. The observation that Plk1 is overexpressed in multiple
human malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gave rise to
the development of several small-molecule inhibitors. Volasertib, presently the
most extensively studied Plk1 inhibitor, has been validated to efficiently reduce
tumor growth in preclinical settings. Unfortunately, only modest antitumor
activity against solid tumors was reported in clinical trials. This discrepancy
prompted research into the identification of predictive biomarkers. In this
study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of volasertib monotherapy (i.e.,
cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cell death, cellular senescence,
and migration) in a panel of NSCLC cell lines differing in p53 status under both 
normal and reduced oxygen tension (<0.1% O2 ). A strong growth inhibitory effect 
was observed in p53 wild-type cells (A549 and A549-NTC), with IC50 values
significantly lower than those in p53 knockdown/mutant cells (A549-920 and
NCI-H1975) (P < 0.001). While mitotic arrest was significantly greater in cells
with nonfunctional p53 (P < 0.005), apoptotic cell death (P < 0.026) and cellular
senescence (P < 0.021) were predominantly induced in p53 wild-type cells.
Overall, the therapeutic effect of volasertib was reduced under hypoxia
(P < 0.050). Remarkably, volasertib inhibited cell migration in all cell lines
tested (P < 0.040), with the exception of for the NCI-H1975 p53 mutant cell line.
In conclusion, our results show an important difference in the therapeutic effect
of Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC cells with versus without functional p53. Overall,
the p53 wild-type cell lines were more sensitive to volasertib treatment,
suggesting that p53 might be a predictive biomarker for Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC.
Moreover, our results pave the way for new combination strategies with Plk1
inhibitors to enhance antitumor activity.

BACKGROUND: A germline deletion in BIM (B cell lymphoma-2-like 11) gene has been 
shown to impair the apoptotic response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro but its impact on response to
EGFR-TKIs in patients of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial.
METHODS: Eligible literature were searched and screened. Objective response rate 
(ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were extracted and aggregated with odds
ratio (OR). Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted and
aggregated based on random-effect model.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies including 2694 NSCLC patients were eligible.
Individuals harboring BIM deletion polymorphism had inferior ORR (OR = 0.49, 95% 
CI: 0.34-0.70, P < .001), inferior DCR (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30-0.84, P = .009). 
Patients with BIM deletion had shorter OS despite of the heterogeneity between
countries (in subgroup of South Korea and Taiwan, HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.53,
P < .001; in subgroup of other countries, HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 2.03-2.91,
P < .001). The pooled analysis of PFS showed great heterogeneity (I = 79%). All
the reported characteristics did not account for the heterogeneity. However, 2
subgroups could be obtained through sensitivity analysis. In one subgroup,
patients with BIM deletion polymorphism had shorter PFS (HR = 2.03, 95% CI:
1.71-2.40, P < .001), while in the other subgroup, no significant difference was 
observed (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06, P = .25).
CONCLUSION: NSCLC patients with BIM deletion polymorphism show poor ORR, DCR, and
OS after EGFR-TKIs treatment. BIM deletion polymorphism indicates poor response
to EGFR-TKIs, and it could be used as a predictor to identify those who would
benefit from EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between OCT4 and clinicopathological features in lung
cancer is controversial from the recently publications. Therefore, we conducted
this meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the prognostic and
clinicopathologic characteristics of OCT4 in lung cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
Library, WOS, CNKI and Wanfang databases was performed to identify studies.
Correlations between OCT4 expression and survival outcomes or clinicopathological
features were analyzed using meta-analysis methods.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies with 2523 patients were included. High OCT4
expression has a poorer overall survival (OS) (univariate: HR= 2.00, 95% CI =
(1.68, 2.39), p<0.0001; multivariate: HR= 2.43, 95% CI = (1.67, 3.55), p<0.0001) 
and median overall survival (MSR = 0.51, 95% CI = (0.44, 0.58), p < 0.0001),
disease-free survival (DFS) (HR= 2.18, 95% CI = (1.30, 3.67), p = 0.003) and
poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR= 2.23, 95% CI = (1.21, 4.11), p =
0.010). Furthermore, high OCT4 expression related with lower 5 year
disease-specific survival rate (OR= 0.24, 95% CI = (0.14, 0.41), p<0.0001) and 10
year overall survival rate (OR= 0.22, 95% CI = (0.12, 0.40), p=0.0001).
Additionally, OCT4-high expression was also strongly associated with higher
clinical TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor distant metastasis, higher
histopathologic grade, but not related with gender, smoking status, tumor size
and histologic type of lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: OCT4 over-expression in lung cancer was strongly related poorer
clinicopathological features and worse survival outcomes, which suggests that
OCT4 could be a valuable prognostic marker in lung cancer.

The impact of the tumor immune microenvironment on overall survival in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been studied, but there is little information on its
relevance for risk of relapse after surgery. Understanding more about the immune 
microenvironment in previously untreated NSCLC could help in identifying
high-risk patients and patients more likely to benefit from neoadjuvant/ adjuvant
immunotherapy. Here, we examined gene expression in 399 surgically-derived NSCLC 
samples and 47 samples from normal lung, using Agilent microarray and RNA
sequencing. In 335 of the tumor samples programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression was used to
estimate content of immune cells and to calculate an immune score. Properties of 
the immune microenvironment, and its impact on prognosis, were compared in
histological subgroups and gene expression subtypes. Tumors with an active immune
microenvironment were found for both adenocarcinomas (AD) and squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC). In AD, high immune score and high estimates of several immune
cell types belonging to the adaptive immune system were associated with better
progression free survival (PFS), while in SCC, no association between immune
characteristics and PFS was found. The immune microenvironment, including PD-L1
expression, and its impact on prognosis showed clear differences in AD and SCC
gene expression subtypes. In conclusion, the NSCLC immune microenvironment is
predictive of prognosis after surgery. Lung AD and SCC gene expression subtypes
should be investigated as potential prognostic biomarkers in patients treated
with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We identified computational imaging features on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (PET) that predict recurrence/progression in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively identified 291 patients with NSCLC from 2
prospectively acquired cohorts (training, n = 145; validation, n = 146). We
contoured the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on all pretreatment PET images and
added a 3-dimensional penumbra region that extended outward 1 cm from the tumor
surface. We generated 512 radiomics features, selected 435 features based on
robustness to contour variations, and then applied randomized sparse regression
(LASSO) to identify features that predicted time to recurrence in the training
cohort. We built Cox proportional hazards models in the training cohort and
independently evaluated the models in the validation cohort. Two features
including stage and a MTV plus penumbra texture feature were selected by LASSO.
Both features were significant univariate predictors, with stage being the best
predictor (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.95], P 
< .001). However, adding the MTV plus penumbra texture feature to stage
significantly improved prediction (P = .006). This multivariate model was a
significant predictor of time to recurrence in the training cohort (concordance =
0.74 [95% CI: 0.66-0.81], P < .001) that was validated in a separate validation
cohort (concordance = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67-0.81], P < .001). A combined radiomics
and clinical model improved NSCLC recurrence prediction. FDG PET radiomic
features may be useful biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and add clinical
utility for risk stratification.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NEF is a newly discovered lncRNA, which exhibits an 
inhibitory function on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its
involvement in other types of malignancy are unknown. In the present study, tumor
and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and blood was obtained from patients with NSCLC and healthy
individuals. Expression levels of lncRNA-NEF in tumor tissue samples, healthy
tissue samples and serum were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis and survival curve analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic
and prognostic value of serum lncRNA-NEF for NSCLC. The effects of lncRNA-NEF
overexpression in NSCLC cell lines on tumor cell proliferation, glucose uptake,
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression and mRNA expression were
investigated by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, glucose uptake assay, western blot
analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. It was identified that lncRNA-NEF was
downregulated in NSCLC tissues, compared with healthy controls, and the serum
level of lncRNA-NEF was negatively associated with primary tumor stage.
Therefore, serum lncRNA-NEF may be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker
for NSCLC. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEF inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and
glucose uptake, and downregulated GLUT1 expression. Therefore, it can be
concluded that lncRNA-NEF can target glucose transportation to inhibit the
proliferation of NSCLC cells.

KRAS is the most frequent oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a
molecular subset characterized by historical disappointments in targeted
treatment approaches such as farnesyl transferase inhibition, downstream MEK
inhibition, and synthetic lethality screens. Unlike other important mutational
subtypes of NSCLC, preclinical work supports the hypothesis that KRAS mutations
may be vulnerable to immunotherapy approaches, an efficacy associated in
particular with TP53 co-mutation. In this review we detail reasons for previous
failures in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, evidence to suggest that KRAS mutation is a
genetic marker of benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition, and emerging direct 
inhibitors of K-Ras which will soon be combined with immunotherapy during
clinical development. With signs of real progress in this subgroup of unmet need,
we anticipate that KRAS mutant NSCLC will be the most important molecular subset 
of cancer to evaluate the combination of small molecules and immune checkpoint
inhibitors (CPI).

BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung
malignancies and its prognosis is dismal. Although early studies have shown
promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockers, the immune composition
and expression of potentially actionable immunostimulatory targets in this
malignancy are poorly understood.
METHODS: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the
levels of 3 different B7 family ligands PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and major tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue
microarray format. Associations between the marker levels, clinicopathological
variables and survival were studied.
RESULTS: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of 
SCLC cases. The markers showed limited co-expression and were not associated with
the level of TILs, age, gender and stage. Elevated B7-H4 was associated with
shorter 5-year overall survival. The levels of CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TILs and the 
ratio of total/effector T-cells were significantly lower in SCLC than in
non-small cell lung cancer. High levels of CD3+, but not CD8+ or CD20+ TILs were 
significantly associated with longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicate variable expression and clinical 
role of B7-family ligands in SCLC with predominant expression of the candidate
target B7-H3 and the presence of a limited cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. 
These results support the evaluation of B7-H3 blockers and/or pro-inflammatory
therapies in SCLC.

BACKGROUND: CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the
response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and 
small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to
be elucidated.
METHODS: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access
Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5
and then every two cycles until patient's withdrawn from the study. All patients 
underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were
classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured
with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno
radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after
4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over
baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR:
CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS).
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a
disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles
of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was
significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS
(CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1,
p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1
reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The reduction in serum level of CYFRA21-1 or CEA might be a reliable 
biomarker to predict immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients. NSE was not
significant for monitoring the efficacy of nivolumab.

cells.

University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.

Ubiquitin activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) is a basic component of E1-activating enzyme
in the SUMOylation system. Expression and function of UBA2 in human cancers are
largely unknown. In this study we investigate UBA2 expression the function in
human non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunochemistry study showed that UBA2 was
overexpressed in cancer tissues (53.3%, 40 of 75) compared with normal lung
tissues (14.3%, 4 of 28) (P < 0.05). Immunostaining of UBA2 was mainly detected
in nucleus. Overexpression of UBA2 in cancer tissues was significantly associated
with poor differentiation, large tumor size ( > 5.0 cm), higher T stages
(T3 + 4), lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages (III + IV). In vitro
study showed that UBA2 was expressed in A549, 95D, H1975, and H1299 cells.
Knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation
and upregulated cancer cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cell significantly increased the G1 and G2/M phase
cells and reduced the S phase cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression profile after
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells showed that the most related function was cell
cycle, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Western
blot analysis study showed that knockdown of UBA2 significantly inhibited
expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, mini-chromosome maintenance 7
(MCM7), MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7. These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical
cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this
malignant tumor.

BACKGROUND: Aggressive behavior of tumor metastasis comes from certain mutations,
changes in cellular metabolic and signaling pathways that are majorly altered by 
tumor microenvironment (TME), its other components and growth factors like
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) which is chiefly known for its epithelial 
to mesenchymal transformation (EMT). EMT is a critical step of metastasis cascade
in actual human lung cancer scenario.
OBJECTIVE: Our present study is focused to unveil the in-vivo metastatic behavior
of TGF-β1 treated lung cancer cells that undergone EMT.
METHODS: The lung cancer epithelial A549 cells were treated in-vitro with TGF-β1 
(3-5ng/ml for 72 h) for EMT. After confirming the transformation of cells by
phenotype modifications, wound healing and cell migration assay and qRT-PCR
analyses of EMT biomarkers including E. Cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, MMP2 and
MMP9; those TGF-β1 modified cells were probed with fluorescent trackers and were 
injected into tail vein of BALB/c nude mice for metastatic dissemination studies.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that distribution of TGF-β1 treated A549 cells as 
compared to W.T A549 towards lungs is less in terms of total relative fluorescent
cluster count, however the difference is insignificant (52±4, 60±5 respectively).
Additionally we show that TGF-β1 treated cells tend to metastasize almost 2, 3,
1.5, 2 and 1.7 times more than W.T towards liver, brain, ovaries, bones and
adrenal gland respectively which is very much like human lung cancer metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively it is ever first study reporting that a pre-treatment of
cells with TGF-β1 for experimental lung cancer metastasis mouse model may portray
more precise approach for the development of potential therapeutic treatments.
Additional pre-treatment studies with the application of other TME conditions
like hypoxia and factors like NFκB, VEGF etc. may be a future prospect to develop
a better understanding.

To investigate the associations between the functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-125 family and the survival of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we systematically selected six functional SNPs
located in three pre-miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b-1, miR-125b-2). Cox proportional 
hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Reporter gene
luciferase assay was performed to examine the relationship between the SNPs and
transcriptive activity of the miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs in different cells
was detected using quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that rs2241490
(upstream of miR-125b-1, G > A, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.014,
in dominant model; adjusted HR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.03-1.35, P = 0.014, in additive 
model), rs512932 (upstream of miR-125b-1, A > G, dominant model: adjusted
HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.013) and rs8111742 (upstream of miR-125a,
G > A, dominant model: adjusted HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.71-1.00, P = 0.047) were
associated with the prognosis of 1001 Chinese NSCLC patients. The combined
analysis of the three SNPs related the number of risk alleles (rs2241490-A,
rs512932-G and rs8111742-G) to death risk of NSCLC in a locus-dosage mode (P for 
trend <0.001). Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay showed significantly
higher levels of luciferase activity with rs512932 variant G than that with A
allele in 293T, SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines. Besides, miR-125b was highly
expressed in lung cancer cells than the normal lung cell. Our study indicated
that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of
NSCLC patients. Larger population-based and functional studies are needed to
verify these findings.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by
inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the
effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC
gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were
identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical
evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants
with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS)
were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1
Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing
and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366
patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or 
Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set 
(HR adjusted for age, gender, smoking habits, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status, histology, and stage [aHR] and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87,
Cox P=0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 
and 0.36-0.93, Cox P=0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1
gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an
important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC
patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: No definitive biomarker exists for predicting treatment efficacy 
or response to therapy with antibody to programmed cell death-1 (PD1) for
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hence, we investigated
whether the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) predicted anti-PD1 treatment response 
for advanced NSCLC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively identified 47 patients with
NSCLC treated with anti-PD1 and assessed the prognostic value of the GPS. The GPS
was calculated using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations 1 month after 
starting anti-PD1 treatment. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard
models were used to examine differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall
(OS) survival, and clinical response.
RESULTS: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted anti-PD1 treatment
efficacy, as a good post-treatment GPS (GPS 0-1) was significantly associated
with improved PFS. Intra-treatment GPS change was associated with clinical
response.
CONCLUSION: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted efficacy of anti-PD1
treatment for NSCLC.

Formenti et al. have recently reported the clinical outcomes and translational
readouts of a trial of the anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, in combination with
palliative radiotherapy in 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A
radiological response was seen in 18% of patients and 31% of patients experienced
disease control. These clinical outcomes appear to be superior to historical
studies using ipilimumab alone and suggest that radiation may have triggered
systemic, so-called abscopal, immune responses in some patients. Induction of
interferon-beta (IFN-β) and maximal expansion and contraction of distinct T cell 
receptor clones were the most significant factors predicting response.
Importantly, established predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy
alone, including the expression of PD-L1 in diagnostic biopsies and tumour
mutational burden, did not predict response. The report provides important human 
qualification of pre-clinical mechanistic insights indicating that abscopal
responses can be generated with optimised radiotherapy fractionation schedules
and anti-CTLA-4 inhibition. Additionally, an intriguing mechanism by which
radiation can be immunogenic is described, namely radiation-induced
transcriptional upregulation of neo-antigens.

Pemetrexed (MTA) is a folate antimetabolite used for treating non-small cell lung
cancer. To elucidate the mechanisms of pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer, we
established pemetrexed-resistant sublines in PC9 (mutant EGFR) and H1993
(wild-type EGFR) lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC9-MTA, H1993-MTA). Gene
expression profile comparison by microarray analyses revealed enhanced fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, confirmed by
Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ERK phosphorylation was increased in
PC9-MTA but decreased in H1993-MTA along with decreased downstream signaling
molecule phosphorylation. Cellular morphological change from epithelial to
spindle-shape together with increased mesenchymal marker protein expression was
observed in H1993-MTA. SiRNA-mediated FGF2 knockdown partially restored
pemetrexed sensitivity in both lines, whereas anti-FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074
restored pemetrexed sensitivity in PC9-MTA. FGF2 or FGFR1 inhibition decreased
pERK levels in PC9-MTA but increased pEGFR levels together with downstream
signaling molecule activation and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition
marker protein expression in H1993-MTA. Although thymidylate synthase strongly
facilitates the development of pemetrexed resistance, our results reveal
involvement of the FGF2-FGFR1 pathway in pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer
cells and suggest that cellular function alterations induced by FGF2-FGFR1
pathway activation depend on the innate feature of cancer cells.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas (PSC) are a rare group of lung cancer with a
median overall survival of 9-12 months. PSC are divided into five histotypes,
challenging to diagnose and treat. The identification of PSC biomarkers is
warranted, but PSC molecular profile remains to be defined. Herein, a targeted
whole transcriptome analysis was performed on 14 PSC samples, evaluated also for 
the presence of the main oncogene mutations and rearrangements. PSC expression
data were compared with transcriptome data of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and
squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Deregulated genes
were used for pathway enrichment analysis; the most representative genes were
tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent cohort (30 PSC, 31 LUAD,
31 LUSC). All PSC cases were investigated for PD-L1 expression. Thirty-eight
genes deregulated in PSC were identified, among these IGJ and SLMAP were
confirmed by IHC. Moreover, Forkhead box signaling and Fanconi anemia pathways
were specifically enriched in PSC. Finally, some PSC harboured alterations in
genes targetable by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as EGFR and MET. We provide a
deep molecular characterization of PSC; the identification of specific molecular 
profiles, besides increasing our knowledge on PSC biology, might suggest new
strategies to improve patients management.

Gustave Roussy Immune Score Is a Prognostic Factor for Chemotherapy-Naive
Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma With Wild-Type Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

Background: The Gustave Roussy Immune Score (GRIm-Score) was developed based on
the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score for the purpose of a better
patient selection for immunotherapy phase I trials. This scoring system is simply
calculated by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
serum albumin concentration. The aim of our study was to determine whether
GRIm-Score is a practically useful prognostic biomarker for advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or
epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
Methods: This retrospective and single institutional study collected 185
adenocarcinomas without active EGFR mutation, 115 squamous cell carcinomas
treated with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 140 NSCLCs with mutant EGFR
treated with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy. These treatments
were initiated between July 2007 and March 2018 at our hospital. We compared
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low
GRIm-Score groups. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we also
found prognostic factors of survival times.
Results: The OS and PFS of low GRIm-Score group were significantly longer than
those of high-score group in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (low vs. high; median 
OS, 18.4 vs. 5.1 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 5.8 vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.01) 
and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (median OS, 38.9 vs. 10.4 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS,
15.9 vs. 5.0 months, P < 0.01). Subsequent multivariate analyses detected high
GRIm-Score in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma as a poor prognostic factor of OS
(hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.47 - 3.31, P < 0.01), and in the EGFR-mutant
NSCLC as a poor prognostic factor of PFS (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00 - 3.55, P =
0.049).
Conclusions: High GRIm-Score was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS of
first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma and of PFS of
first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Therefore, GRIm-Score
is not only a specific selection marker for experimental immunotherapy trials,
but may also be a promising and useful pretreatment prognostic maker for specific
NSCLC subsets in the real-world practice.

Pretreatment Lung Immune Prognostic Index Is a Prognostic Marker of Chemotherapy 
and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

Background: Lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) was recently developed on the
basis of the combination of baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio
(dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This index was demonstrated as a specific
biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We aimed to show that LIPI may be a useful biomarker of cytotoxic chemotherapy
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for
NSCLC.
Methods: We retrospectively collected 175 wild-type EGFR adenocarcinomas, 131
NSCLCs harboring mutant EGFR and 110 squamous cell carcinomas. All patients
initiated first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI monotherapy between July 
2007 and August 2017 at our hospital. These patients were divided into good,
intermediate and poor LIPI groups. We compared their overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analyses detected prognostic and
predictive factors of OS and PFS.
Results: The good LIPI group survived longer than the intermediate and poor LIPI 
groups in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups:
median 19.6, 11.5 and 3.3 months, P < 0.01, respectively) and mutant EGFR NSCLC
(45.4, 25.6 and 15.7 months, P < 0.01). The PFS of good LIPI group was
significantly longer that those of the other two groups in mutant EGFR NSCLC
(16.6, 12.6 and 8.3 months, P < 0.01). The intermediate group (hazard ratio (HR) 
1.49, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.15, P = 0.04) of wild-type EGFR
adenocarcinoma, intermediate (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 - 3.99, P < 0.01) and poor (HR
2.76, 95% CI 1.03 - 7.42, P = 0.04) groups of mutant EGFR NSCLC were independent 
prognostic factors of poor OS. The intermediate (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.44, P =
0.04) and poor (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.14 - 6.07, P = 0.02) groups were significant
prognostic factors of PFS of mutant EGFR NSCLC.
Conclusions: LIPI was an independent prognostic factor of chemotherapy for
adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR and of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC harboring mutant
EGFR. Thus, LIPI was not a specific biomarker for ICI therapy, but a useful
biomarker for chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI therapy in specific subsets of NSCLC.

In lung cancer, antiangiogenic strategies targeting tumor-derived endothelial
cells (TECs) afford a survival advantage, but the characteristics of TECs have
not been comprehensively elucidated. Herein, high-purity (> 98%) TECs were
obtained, and these cells retained expression of EC markers and exhibited high
viability. ITRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS was performed to profile the proteome and the
heterogeneity of ECs. Only 31 of 1820 identified proteins were differentially
expressed between adenocarcinoma (ADC)- and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-derived
TECs (TEC-A and TEC-S, respectively), and cadherin-2 (CDH2) was the most
significantly upregulated protein in TEC-A samples. Positive immunostaining for
CDH2 (score > 3) was significantly more frequent in the endothelium of ADC
tissues than in that of SCC tissues. Loss- or gain-of-function analysis showed
that CDH2 significantly promoted in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and
sensitivity to the antagonist exherin. The MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNK signaling
pathways may play crucial roles in CDH2-induced HIF-1α/VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis. Moreover, high CDH2 expression in TECs was significantly associated
with tumor stage, visceral pleural metastasis, and decreased overall survival in 
patients with ADC but not SCC. Together, these data indicate the importance of
CDH2 in angiogenesis and highlight its potential both for antiangiogenic therapy 
and as a candidate prognostic marker for ADC.

Treatment of advanced-stage or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, which can now be treated with
molecularly targeted therapies, had been based on cytotoxic chemotherapy for a
long time. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed
against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have
transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the
reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their
efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was
validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab,
atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with
chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III 
trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in
combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation
burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most
from first-line ICI use.

OBJECTIVE: The abnormal expression of the key enzymes in glycolytic pathways,
including glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-3, hexokinase-II, lactate
dehydrogenase 5, pyruvate kinase M2, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
transketolase-like protein 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 was reported to 
be associated with poor prognosis of various cancers. However, the association
remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the
prognostic significance of glycolysis-related proteins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using Pubmed 
and Ovid as search engines and Google Scholar from inception to April 2017.
Eighty-six studies with 12,002 patients were included in the study.
RESULTS: Our pooled results identified that glycolysis-related proteins in
cancers were associated with shorter overall survival of colorectal cancer (HR
2.33, 95% CI 1.38-3.93, P = 0.002), gastric cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.82,
P < 0.001), cancer of gallbladder or bile duct (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70-2.75,
P < 0.001), oral cancer (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.25, P < 0.001), esophageal cancer
(HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25-2.21, P = 0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 2.04, 95% CI 
1.64-2.54, P < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.39-2.13, P < 0.001), 
breast cancer(HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08, P < 0.001), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.75-7.36, P < 0.001). No association was found for lung cancer,
ovarian cancer or melanoma. The key glycolytic transcriptional regulators
(HIF-1α, p53) were analyzed in parallel to the glycolysis-related proteins, and
the pooled results identified that high-level expression of HIF-1α was
significantly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI
0.42-0.79, P < 0.001) Furthermore, glycolysis-related proteins linked with poor
differentiated tumors (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46-2.25, P < 0.001), positive lymph node
metastasis (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.16-3.46, P < 0.001), positive vascular invasion (OR
2.05, 95% CI 1.37-3.07, P < 0.001), large tumor size (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.80-2.37, 
P < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19-2.09, P < 0.001), and
deeper invasion (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.93-2.91, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Glycolytic transcriptional regulators and glycolysis-related proteins
in cancers were significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting
glycolytic status may be potentially valuable prognostic biomarkers for various
cancers.

Early elevation of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, or CRP, which
is a surrogate marker for IL-6, following commencement of PD-1/L1 inhibitors
(PD1-I) may represent early activation of immune-cells. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were
measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 
7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were
reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the
treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum
levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and
post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453;
TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four
responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response 
rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased
after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably,
in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6
or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median
overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in
the non-elevated group (p = 0.069). The early increase in inflammatory cytokines 
with PD1-I was indicated to be predictive for the efficacy in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer.

Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), have been
linked to higher tumor mutation burden and improved response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. However, the significance of MMR mutations in lung cancer has not
been well characterized, and the relevance of other processes, including
homologous recombination (HR) and polymerase epsilon (POLE) activity, remains
unclear. Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from
The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with
increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with
greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA
repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of
TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and
DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high
neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic
activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair 
pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific
immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as
biomarkers for immunotherapy.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly inhibitors of the PD-1 axis,
have altered the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the last
ten years. First demonstrated to improve outcomes in second-line or later therapy
of advanced disease, ICIs were shown to improve overall survival (OS) compared to
chemotherapy in first line therapy for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 on at 
least 50% of cells. More recently, combining ICIs with chemotherapy has been
shown to improve survival in patients with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC,
regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 and, more recently, tumor
mutational burden (TMB) have not proven to be straightforward indicative
biomarkers. We describe the advances to date in utilizing these biomarkers, as
well as novel markers of tumor inflammation, to ascertain which patients are most
likely to benefit from ICIs. Ongoing translational work promises to improve the
proportion of patients who benefit from these agents.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most
promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies
that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy,
ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by
the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis
leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has
been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 
have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers,
including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful
ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy
significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival 
with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for
advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical
applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and
acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and
treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest
clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide,
as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this
therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the
application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in 
cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed
cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment
of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical
applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population 
with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses
the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate
guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the
criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies,
and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination
therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: HOTTIP, a long non-coding RNA located in the HOXA cluster, plays a
role in the patterning of tissues with mesodermal components, including the lung.
Overexpression of HOXA genes, including HOTTIP, has been associated with a more
aggressive phenotype in several cancers. However, the prognostic impact of HOTTIP
has not yet been explored in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have
correlated HOTTIP expression with time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS)
in early-stage NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Ninety-nine early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection 
in our center from June 2007 to November 2013 were included in the study. Mean
age was 66; 77.8% were males; 73.7% had stage I disease; and 55.5% had
adenocarcinoma. A validation data set comprised stage I-II patients from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network.
RESULTS: HOTTIP was expressed in all tumor samples and was overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.007) and in smokers (p = 0.018). Patients with
high levels of HOTTIP had shorter TTR (78.3 vs 58 months; p = 0.048) and shorter 
OS (81.2 vs 61 months; p = 0.023) than those with low levels. In the multivariate
analysis, HOTTIP emerged as an independent prognostic marker for TTR (OR: 2.05,
95%CI: 1-4.2; p = 0.05), and for OS (OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.04-5.1; p = 0.04). HOTTIP
was validated as a prognostic marker for OS in the TCGA adenocarcinoma cohort
(p = 0.025). Moreover, we identified a 1203-mRNA and a 61-miRNA signature that
correlated with HOTTIP expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The lncRNA HOTTIP can be considered a prognostic biomarker in
early-stage NSCLC.

Lung cancer is a complex disease involving multiple genetic and phenotypic
alterations. As a histone modification enzyme, protein‑arginine deiminase type‑4 
(PADI4) and its downstream signaling have been studied in the progression of a
variety of types of human cancer, but data on PADI4‑mediated posttranslational
modification in lung cancer are lacking. The aim of present study was to evaluate
the expression of PADI4 and its associated molecular signaling in lung cancer
metastasis. The results of the present study indicated that PADI4 was
overexpressed in lung cancer cells, while knockdown of PADI4 could lead to
attenuation of the lung cancer cell invasion and migration phenotype, which was
further verified by determining the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)
marker proteins. Additionally, it was demonstrated that stable knockdown of PADI4
in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a striking reduction of the EMT‑associated 
Snail1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3/4 transcriptional complex, which
was consistent with alterations in migratory and invasive phenotypes of A549 lung
cancer cells. Therefore, PADI4‑mediated EMT transition is proposed to represent a
novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic and phenotypic alterations in lung
cancer cells, and the PADI4 associated signaling pathway may be a therapeutic
target for treating lung cancer in a clinical setting.

Ehm2 [also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1‑like protein 4B
(EPB41L4B)] is a member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. The overexpression of
Ehm2 has been observed in metastatic cancer cells. Through alternative splicing, 
the Ehm2 gene produces two transcript variants that encode the two different
isoforms, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2. The biological functions of these different Ehm2
transcript variants remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the
expression of the Ehm2 variants in lung adenocarcinoma and their involvement in
the disease progression of the patients. The expression of Ehm2 transcript
variants in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues was analyzed using
immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Ehm2 variants were overexpressed 
or knocked down in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The consequent effects
of the genetic modifications on the cellular functions of lung cancer cells were 
then examined using in vitro cell viability, invasion and migration assays. The
expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related markers was
evaluated by western blot analysis in the cell models. The association of Ehm2
variant expression with patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis. The expression of Ehm2/1 was significantly decreased in lung cancers
compared with the paired normal lung tissues (P<0.05), while the Ehm2/2 protein
levels were higher in the tumors than in the paired normal lung tissues, although
this was not statistically significant. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 exerted
inhibitory effects, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 promoted the growth, invasion
and migration of A549 cells in vitro. Ehm2/2 was expressed at low levels in the
A549 cells and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 significantly increased the
invasiveness and migration of the A549 cells. Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that Ehm2/1 was confined to the plasma membrane, while Ehm2/2 was
observed at both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 
resulted in the upregulation of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin, and in the
decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, N‑cadherin and Snail1, while the
knockdown of Ehm2/1 and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 had the opposite
effects on the protein levels of EMT‑related markers. Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis revealed that higher Ehm2/1 transcript levels were associated with the
longer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, while the lower expression 
of Ehm2/2 exhibited a similar association with patient survival. Taken together, 
the two Ehm2 variants appear to be differentially expressed in lung
adenocarcinoma. Ehm2/1 may function as a putative tumor suppressor in the disease
progression of lung adenocarcinoma, while Ehm2/2 may have an opposite function.

BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on lung cancer cells is 
a prognostic marker and a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
However, previous clinical trials have suggested that other programmed cell death
1 ligands, including programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), might have clinical
impacts. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic significance of PD-L2
expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
METHODS: The study included 433 patients who underwent surgical resection for
lung adenocarcinoma between 2003 and 2012 at Kyushu University Hospital. Both
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The cutoff
value for PD-L2 positivity was set at 1% according to a time-dependent receiver
operating characteristic curve for 5-year survival.
RESULTS: Of the 433 patients, 306 (70.7%) were positive for PD-L2. No significant
association between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was observed (P = 0.094). The
multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of PD-L2 positivity 
were never-smoker status (P = 0.002), poor differentiation grade (P = 0.008), and
advanced stage (P = 0.048). The PD-L2-positive patients had significantly shorter
disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.018) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016).
Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 positivity were independent predictors of OS (P < 0.001 and 
P = 0.027, respectively). In the subgroup analysis of the PD-L1-negative
patients, PD-L2 positivity was significantly associated with shorter DFS
(P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of patients
with PD-L1 expression may differ from those of patients with PD-L2 expression,
and that both might contribute to poor prognoses. The potential role of PD-L2
expression as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy should be
investigated in future studies.

Tumor metastasis is a hallmark of cancer, with distant metastasis frequently
developing in lung cancer, even at initial diagnosis, resulting in poor prognosis
and high mortality. However, available biomarkers cannot reliably predict cancer 
spreading sites. The metastatic cascade involves highly complicated processes
including invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition that are tightly controlled by various genetic expression modalities
along with interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix. In
particular, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, can influence
the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, with dysregulation of
miRNA expression contributing to the regulation of cancer metastasis.
Nevertheless, although miRNA-targeted therapy is widely studied in vitro and in
vivo, this strategy currently affords limited feasibility and a few
miRNA-targeted therapies for lung cancer have entered into clinical trials to
date. Advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of metastasis will thus
provide additional potential targets for lung cancer treatment. This review
discusses the current research related to the role of miRNAs in lung cancer
invasion and metastasis, with a particular focus on the different metastatic
lesions and potential miRNA-targeted treatments for lung cancer with the
expectation that further exploration of miRNA-targeted therapy may establish a
new spectrum of lung cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: ING5 is the last member of the Inhibitor of Growth (ING) candidate
tumor suppressor family that has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, 
including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. Our
previous study showed that ING5 overexpression inhibits lung cancer
aggressiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with unknown
mechanisms.
METHODS: Western blotting was used to detect total and phosphorylated levels of
β-catenin and EMT-related proteins. Immunofluorescent staining was used to
observe E-cadherin expression. Proliferation and colony formation, wound healing,
and Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to study the
proliferative and invasive abilities of cancer cells.
RESULTS: ING5 overexpression promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37,
leading to a decreased β-catenin protein level. Small hairpin RNA-mediated ING5
knockdown significantly increased the β-catenin level and inhibited
phosphorylation of β-catenin S33/37. Treatment with the WNT/β-catenin inhibitor
XAV939 inhibited ING5-knockdown promoted proliferation, colony formation,
migration, and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells, with increased phosphorylation
of β-catenin S33/37 and a decreased β-catenin level. XAV939 also impaired
ING5-knockdown-induced EMT, as indicated by upregulated expression of the EMT
marker E-cadherin, an epithelial marker; and decreased expression of N-cadherin, 
a mesenchymal marker, and EMT-related transcription factors, including Snail,
Slug, Twist, and Smad3. Furthermore, XAV939 could inhibit the activation of both 
IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: ING5 inhibits lung cancer invasion and EMT by inhibiting the
WNT/β-catenin pathway.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, whereby mature epithelial 
cells undergo phenotype transition and differentiate into motile, invasive cells,
has been indicated in tumor metastasis. The melatonin hormone secreted by the
pineal gland has an antioxidant effect and protects cells against carcinogenic
substances that reduce tumor progression. However, the effects of melatonin in
EMT and lung cancer metastasis are largely unknown. We found that melatonin
down-regulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription
factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and 
β-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with
tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer
specimens. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited EMT marker expression and lung cancer
metastasis to liver in vivo Finally, melatonin shows promise in the treatment of 
lung cancer metastasis and deserves further study.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CYP2A13
polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility using the HapMap database.
METHODS: A case-control analysis of 532 subjects with lung cancer and 614
controls with no personal history of the disease was performed. The tag SNPs
rs1645690 and rs8192789 for CYP2A13 were selected, and the genetic polymorphisms 
were confirmed experimentally through real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing
assay.
RESULTS: SNP frequency in this study was consistent with the HapMap Project
database of Han-Chinese and lung cancer risk was associated with CYP2A13
polymorphisms in non-smokers. CYP2A13 shares a 93.5% identity with CYP2A6 in the 
amino acid sequence and the homologous sequences may interfere with the study of 
SNPs of CYP2A13.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2A13 may be a potential key metabolic enzyme gene in the
carcinogenesis of lung cancer in non-smokers. The common polymorphisms of CYP2A13
may be candidate biomarkers for lung cancer susceptibility in Han-Chinese.

Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, is a major disease that threatens the
worldwide population. Among all cancer types, lung cancer has the highest
morbidity rate, with a survival rate of less than 5%. Various studies have
focused on discovering a potent anticancer drug that will increase the survival
rate of lung cancer patients. Lutein (3,3'-dihydroxy-β, ε-carotene), a carotenoid
present in fruits and vegetables, is one such compound that possesses excellent
antioxidant properties. The present study was designed to determine the
anticancer effect of lutein against A549, a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line.
The cytotoxic effect of lutein against lung cancer cells (A549 and HCC827) and
normal cells (BEAS-2B) was detected by MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The
Transwell assay was performed to detect the inhibitory potential of lutein
against cell invasion and migration of A549 cells. The induction of apoptosis by 
lutein in A549 was analyzed by a double-staining technique using TUNEL (terminal 
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) and DAPI
(4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining assays to confirm the molecular
mechanism exhibited by lutein to induce apoptosis through regulating the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling molecules that are often
deregulated in cancerous condition. The results show that lutein inhibits the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in A549, which may therefore be 
used as a potent natural anticancer drug with no side effects to treat lung
cancer.

Lung adenocarcinoma is one of the most common cancers worldwide. However, the
molecular mechanisms of lung adenocarcinoma development are still unclear. This
study aimed to investigate the expression profiles of anti-lung cancer target
genes in different cancer stages and to explore their functions in tumor
development. Lung adenocarcinoma transcriptome and clinical data were downloaded 
from Genomic Data Commons Data Portal, and the anti-lung cancer target genes were
retrieved from the Thomson Reuters Integrity database. The results showed that 16
anti-lung target genes were deregulated in all stages. Among these target genes, 
fibroblast growth factor 22 showed the most important role in transcription
regulatory networks. Further analysis revealed that APC, BRIP1, and PTTG1 may
regulate fibroblast growth factor 22 and subsequently influence MAPK signaling
pathway, Rap1 signaling pathways, and other tumorigenic processes in all stages. 
Moreover, high fibroblast growth factor 22 expression leads to poor overall
survival (hazard ratio = 1.55, P = .019). These findings provide valuable
information for the pathological research and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.
Future studies are needed to verify these results.

The receptor-tyrosine-kinase (RTK)-like orphan receptor 1 (ROR1) is a
transmembrane glycoprotein regarded as a tumor-associated antigen. ROR1 plays an 
important role in cancer development, but the detailed function of ROR1 in
diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) remains unclear. In this study, we first
detected ROR1 expression and evaluated the relationship between ROR1 expression
and the clinicopathological characteristics of DLBCL patients. Next we employed
shRNA-mediated knockdown of ROR1 in DLBCL cell line to explore the
characteristics of ROR1 in DLBCL development both in vitro and in vivo. The
results showed a significantly higher level of ROR1 in DLBCL tissues than in
lymphatic hyperplasia tissues. High ROR1 expression was correlated with
unfavorable prognosis in DLBCL patients. Furthermore, ROR1 knockdown inhibited
the growth and induced the apoptosis in DLBCL cells and xenografts. In addition, 
shROR1 inhibited activation of the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway, both in vitro
and in vivo. Taken together, our results suggest that ROR1 is a novel prognostic 
marker for DLBCL survival and ROR1 significantly promotes DLBCL tumorigenesis by 
regulating the PI3K/Akt/mTOR signaling pathway. Targeting ROR1 may provide a
promising strategy for DLBCL treatment. © 2019 BioFactors, 00(00):1-11, 2019.

BACKGROUND: CD44 isoforms serve as a marker for cancer stem cells. CD44 variant 9
(CD44v9) contributes to the defense against reactive oxygen species, resulting in
resistance to chemoradiotherapy. However, the significance of CD44v9 in patients 
with lung adenocarcinoma is unknown.
METHODS: We used immunohistochemical analysis to retrospectively analyze CD44v9
expression in 268 surgically resected lung adenocarcinomas and investigated the
association between CD44v9 expression and patients' clinicopathological features.
RESULTS: The expression of CD44v9 in 193 of 268 (72.0%) patients was
significantly associated with early-stage cancer, low-grade tumors, absence of
vessel and pleural invasion, and a mutated epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) gene. Multivariate logistic analysis revealed that CD44v9 expression was
significantly associated with early-stage disease [odds ratio (OR) 0.29, 95%
confidence interval (CI) 0.14-0.59; p < 0.001] and mutant EGFR (OR 2.53, 95% CI
1.06-6.04; p = 0.036). The percentage of CD44v9-positive tumors was higher in the
earlier stages of disease; however, there was no significant difference in the
survival of patients in each stage of disease who had positive or negative CD44v9
expression.
CONCLUSION: CD44v9 was highly expressed in EGFR-mutant tumors, particularly in
early-stage lung adenocarcinoma, suggesting that CD44v9 expression may play an
important role in EGFR-mutant tumors.

BACKGROUND: Treatment with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-tyrosine
kinase inhibitors (TKIs) leads to initial response in most patients with
EGFR-mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In contrast, little is known of 
the subpopulation of patients with NSCLC with EGFR mutations who exhibit clinical
outcomes that require treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).
Therefore, to identify eligible cases to treat with ICIs, we retrospectively
analyzed the correlation between clinical features and the efficacy of ICIs in
patients with EGFR mutations.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrospectively analyzed patients with advanced NSCLC
harboring EGFR mutations who were treated with ICIs after developing resistance
to EGFR-TKIs between February 2016 and April 2018 at 6 institutions in Japan. The
association between clinical outcomes and the efficacy of ICIs was investigated.
RESULTS: We enrolled 27 patients who harbored EGFR-activating mutations. The
objective response and disease control rates were higher in patients with
uncommon EGFR mutations than in those with common EGFR mutations (71% vs 35.7%
and 57% vs 7%, P = 0.14 and P < 0.01, respectively). Patients with uncommon EGFR 
mutations or without T790M mutations exhibited a significantly longer median
progression-free survival than those with common EGFR mutations or with T790M
mutations (P = 0.003 and P = 0.03, respectively).
CONCLUSION: Patients with uncommon EGFR mutations and without T790M mutations are
associated with the best outcomes for treatment with immunotherapy among those
with EGFR-mutated NSCLC, based on retrospective analysis. Further research is
needed to validate the clinical biomarkers involved in ICI responders with EGFR
mutations.

The regulatory loop between long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs has a
dynamic role in transcriptional and translational regulation, and is involved in 
cancer. However, the regulatory circuitry between lncRNAs and microRNAs in
tumorigenesis remains elusive. Here we demonstrate that a nuclear lncRNA
LINC00336 is upregulated in lung cancer and functions as an oncogene by acting as
a competing endogenous RNA (ceRNAs). LINC00336 bound RNA-binding protein ELAVL1
(ELAV-like RNA-binding protein 1) using nucleotides 1901-2107 of LINC00336 and
the RRM interaction domain and key amino acids (aa) of ELAVL1 (aa 101-213),
inhibiting ferroptosis. Moreover, ELAVL1 increased LINC00336 expression by
stabilizing its posttranscriptional level, whereas LSH (lymphoid-specific
helicase) increased ELAVL1 expression through the p53 signaling pathway, further 
supporting the hypothesis that LSH promotes LINC00336 expression. Interestingly, 
LINC00336 served as an endogenous sponge of microRNA 6852 (MIR6852) to regulate
the expression of cystathionine-β-synthase (CBS), a surrogate marker of
ferroptosis. Finally, we found that MIR6852 inhibited cell growth by promoting
ferroptosis. These data show that the network of lncRNA and ceRNA has an

This study aimed to clarify relationships among UDP-glucose-6 dehydrogenase
(UGDH) expression, clinicopathological factors, and the prognosis of patients,
and to determine the role of UGDH in lung adenocarcinoma (AC). Firstly, UGDH
expression and localization in 126 lung AC tissues were immunohistochemically
studied, and associations with clinicopathological parameters and patients'
prognosis were evaluated. Secondly, serum UGDH levels were measured in 267 lung
cancer patients and 100 healthy controls. Finally, the effects of UGDH knockdown 
by siRNA on migration and invasion abilities were analyzed. As a result, nuclear 
UGDH staining was significantly correlated with poorer differentiation, a larger 
tumor size, higher p-TNM stage, positive nodal metastasis, positive lymphatic
invasion, and positive vascular invasion in lung AC patients. Nuclear
UGDH-positive patients showed significantly poorer survival than nuclear
UGDH-negative patients. Serum UGDH levels were especially higher in lung AC
patients even in stage I than those in healthy controls. In lung AC cell lines,
nuclear expression levels of UGDH were higher in LC-2/ad cells than in A549
cells. UGDH siRNA-treated LC-2/ad cells showed significantly decreased migration 
and invasion abilities, but no significant differences were observed in UGDH
siRNA-treated A549 cells. These data indicate that UGDH expression and
localization are an early sero-diagnostic marker in addition to a poor prognostic
indicator in lung AC patients.

PURPOSE: CheckMate 568 is an open-label phase II trial that evaluated the
efficacy and safety of nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab as first-line treatment
of advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We assessed the
association of efficacy with programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression and
tumor mutational burden (TMB).
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred eighty-eight patients with previously
untreated, recurrent stage IIIB/IV NSCLC received nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks
plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks. The primary end point was objective
response rate (ORR) in patients with 1% or more and less than 1% tumor PD-L1
expression. Efficacy on the basis of TMB (FoundationOne CDx assay) was a
secondary end point.
RESULTS: Of treated patients with tumor available for testing, 252 patients (88%)
of 288 were evaluable for PD-L1 expression and 98 patients (82%) of 120 for TMB. 
ORR was 30% overall and 41% and 15% in patients with 1% or greater and less than 
1% tumor PD-L1 expression, respectively. ORR increased with higher TMB,
plateauing at 10 or more mutations/megabase (mut/Mb). Regardless of PD-L1
expression, ORRs were higher in patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb (n = 48:
PD-L1, ≥ 1%, 48%; PD-L1, < 1%, 47%) versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb (n = 50:
PD-L1, ≥ 1%, 18%; PD-L1, < 1%, 5%), and progression-free survival was longer in
patients with TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb versus TMB of fewer than 10 mut/Mb
(median, 7.1 v 2.6 months). Grade 3 to 4 treatment-related adverse events
occurred in 29% of patients.
CONCLUSION: Nivolumab plus low-dose ipilimumab was effective and tolerable as a
first-line treatment of advanced/metastatic NSCLC. TMB of 10 or more mut/Mb was
associated with improved response and prolonged progression-free survival in both
tumor PD-L1 expression 1% or greater and less than 1% subgroups and was thus
identified as a potentially relevant cutoff in the assessment of TMB as a
biomarker for first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab.

Progastrin-releasing peptide (ProGRP), which is known to be highly specific and
sensitive to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), has been proven to be a valuable
substitute for neuron-specific enolase in SCLC diagnostics and monitoring,
especially in its early stages. The detection of ProGRP levels also facilitates a
selection of therapeutic treatments. For the fabrication of our proposed
biosensor, titanium (IV) oxide microparticles were first used, followed by
dispersing gold nanoparticles into chitosan and immobilizing them onto a carbon
paste electrode (CPE) surface. The developed immunosensor exhibits a much higher 
biosensing performance in comparison with current methods, when it comes to the
detection of ProGRP. Therefore, the proposed
CPE/TiO₂/(CS+AuNPs)/anti-ProGRP/BSA/ProGRP is excellent for the development of a 
compact diagnostics apparatus.

OBJECTIVE: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common cause for
cancer-related mortality worldwide. Currently, early detection of NSCLC is one of
the main available strategies for improving its prognosis. Due to the lack of
non-invasive and convenient tools, early diagnosis of NSCLC remains poor.
Recently, it has been reported that circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) can be stably 
detected in serum. Meanwhile, they play a powerful role as biomarkers in various 
tumors. Therefore, the aim of this study was to detect the expression levels of
serum miR-182, 200b and 205 in NSCLC patients, and to investigate their
diagnostic and prognostic values.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) 
was carried out to measure the expressions of miR-182, 200b and 205 in NSCLC
tissues and normal controls. Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve
analysis was performed to assess the potential value of serum miRNAs for NSCLC
diagnosis. Meanwhile, transwell assays were performed to observe the functional
effects of miRNAs on the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells.
RESULTS: Compared with normal controls, serum levels of miR-182 and 205 in NSCLC 
patients were significantly upregulated, whereas miR-200b was remarkably
downregulated. ROC analysis indicated that miRNA array (miR-182, 200b and 205)
was useful biomarkers for early diagnosis of NSCLC. In addition, transwell assays
demonstrated that miR-182 promoted the invasion and migration of NSCLC cells.
CONCLUSIONS: Our findings revealed that serum miR-182, 200b and 205 might serve
as promising biomarkers for early detection and treatment of NSCLC.

TIMM50 (Translocase of the inner mitochondrial membrane 50), also called TIM50,
plays an essential role in mitochondrial membrane transportation. The existing
literature suggests that TIMM50 may perform as an oncogenetic protein in breast
cancer. However, the molecular mechanism, especially in human non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), is uncertain to date. In the present study, using
immunohistochemistry, we found that TIMM50 expression significantly correlated
with larger tumor size (P = 0.049), advanced TNM stage (P = 0.001), positive
regional lymph node metastasis (P = 0.007), and poor overall survival
(P = 0.001). Proliferation and invasion assay showed that TIMM50 dramatically
promoted the ability of proliferation and invasion of NSCLC cells. Subsequent
Western blotting results revealed that TIMM50 enhanced the expression of Cyclin
D1 and Snail, and inhibited the expression of E-cadherin. Moreover, TIMM50
facilitated the expression of phosphorylated ERK and P90RSK. Incorporation of ERK
inhibitor counteracted the upregulating expression of CyclinD1, and Snail, and
downregulating expression of E-cadherin expression induced by TIMM50
overexpression. In conclusion, our data indicated that TIMM50 facilitated tumor
proliferation and invasion of NSCLC through enhancing phosphorylation of its
downstream ERK/P90RSK signaling pathway. We speculated that TIMM50 might be a
useful prognosis marker of NSCLC patients.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the most common histological form of lung cancer
that is clinically diagnosed. The aim of this study is to explore the novel genes
associated with LUAD tumorigenesis. Comprehensive bioinformatics analyses of the 
data were obtained from several publicly available databases, such as the Gene
Expression Omnibus, the Human Protein Atlas project, and the Cancer Cell Line
Encyclopedia. The clinical relevance of these novel genes in LUAD was further
examined by immunohistochemistry. We identified the overlapping differentially
expressed genes (DEGs) in five independent microarray data sets from the Gene
Expression Omnibus database ( GSE75037 , GSE85716 , GSE85841 , GSE63459 , and
GSE32867 ). Using the criteria of |log (fold change)| ≥ 1 and P value <0.05, 167 
genes were preliminarily validated as co-DEGs. Protein-protein interaction
network analysis indicated that caveolin 1 (CAV1) and decorin (DCN) levels were
significantly reduced and that these genes were the most promising predictive
biomarkers for the occurrence and prognosis of LUAD. A cell proliferation assay
indicated that overexpressed CAV1 and DCN could significantly inhibit the
proliferation rate of A549 and H157 cells. Additionally, these two downregulated 
candidate genes were further verified by immunohistochemistry conducted on a LUAD
tissue array and comprehensive bioinformatics analyses, including those using the
Oncomine platform and the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia. Our study demonstrates
low levels of CAV1 and DCN in LUAD. An understanding of their functional roles in
LUAD biology would give us important insights that would be useful in further
investigations.

Lung cancer continues to be the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide,
with little improvement in patient survival rates in the past decade. Long
non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) are gaining importance as possible biomarkers with
prognostic potential. By large-scale data mining, we identified LINC00261 as a
lncRNA which was significantly downregulated in lung cancer. Low expression of
LINC00261 was associated with recurrence and poor patient survival in lung
adenocarcinoma. Moreover, the gene pair of LINC00261 and its neighbor FOXA2 were 
significantly co-regulated. LINC00261 as well as FOXA2 negatively correlated with
markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and were suppressed by the
EMT inducer TGFβ. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression data from lung
cancer cell lines could further verify the association of high LINC00261/FOXA2
expression to an epithelial gene signature. Furthermore, higher expression of the
LINC00261/FOXA2 locus was associated with lung cancer cell lines with lower
migratory capacity. All these data establish LINC00261 and FOXA2 as an
epithelial-specific marker pair, downregulated during EMT and lung cancer
progression, and associated with lower cell migration potential in lung cancer
cells.

BACKGROUND The aim of this study was to detect the expression of fork-head box D3
(FOXD3) and investigate its diagnostic value in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). MATERIAL AND METHODS The relative expression of FOXD3 at mRNA and
protein levels was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction (qRT-PCR) and Western blotting analysis, respectively. Chi-square 
test was used to explore the relevance of FOXD3 expression with clinical features
of NSCLC patients. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was built to
estimate the diagnostic value of FOXD3 in distinguishing NSCLC patients from
healthy controls. RESULTS Serum FOXD3 expression was weakly expressed in NSCLC
patients compared to the controls at mRNA and protein levels (P<0.001) and low
FOXD3 expression was positively correlated with TNM stage, lymph node metastasis,
and differentiation. The ROC curve indicated that FOXD3 acts as a diagnostic
bio-marker for NSCLC patients, with an AUC of 0.826 corresponding to a
sensitivity of 77.1% and a specificity of 74.6%, and an optimal cutoff point of
2.38. CONCLUSIONS Decreased expression of serum FOXD3 was observed in NSCLC
patients, and it was found to be a potential molecular marker for the diagnosis
of NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: This study investigated the function of SMAD3 (SMAD family member 3) 
in regulating PAX6 (paired box 6) in non-small cell lung cancer.
METHODS: First, qRT-PCR was employed to detect SMAD3 expression in cancer tissues
along with normal tissues and four cell lines, including BEAS-2B, H125, HCC827
and A549 cells. SMAD3 was knocked down by small interference RNA (siRNA), and
then its expression was determined via qRT-PCR and Western blot analysis. The
correlation between SMAD3 and PAX6 was determined by double luciferase reporter
experiments and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay. Cell viability was
evaluated by CCK-8 and colony forming assays, while cell migration and invasion
were detected by Transwell analysis.
RESULTS: SMAD3 and PAX6 were upregulated in lung cancer tissues and cancer cells.
Knocking down SMAD3 and PAX6 by transfection with siRNAs specifically suppressed 
the expression of SMAD3 and PAX6 mRNA and protein levels. SMAD3 could promote
PAX6 transcriptional activity by binding to its promoter. Reduced expression of
SMAD3 led to the downregulation of PAX6 mRNA and protein levels along with
decreased cell migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and
HCC827 cells. PAX6 overexpression altered the si-SMAD3-induced inhibition of cell
migration, invasion, proliferation and viability in A549 and HCC827 cells.
Additionally, PAX6 knockdown alone also repressed the cell migration, invasion,
proliferation and viability of the cell lines.
CONCLUSIONS: SMAD3 promotes the progression of non-small cell lung cancer by
upregulating PAX6 expression.

Vasculogenic mimicry (VM) is a new blood supply style in tumors and has long been
treated as a useful factor in malignant tumor metastasis and prognosis. Notch4 (a
marker of Notch signaling pathway receptors), DLL4 (a marker of Notch signaling
pathway ligands) and KAI1/CD82 (a suppressor gene of tumor metastasis) are all
effective predictive factors for tumor metastasis. In this study, we analyzed
correlations among VM, Notch4, DLL4, and KAI1/CD82 in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC), and their respective associations with patients' clinicopathological
parameters and survival rate in NSCLC.Positive rates of VM, Notch4, DLL4, and
KAI1/CD82 in 189 whole NSCLC specimens were detected by histochemical and
immunohistochemical staining. Moreover, patients' clinicopathological information
was also collected.Positive rates of VM, Notch4, and DLL4 were significantly
higher, and levels of KAI1/CD82 were significantly lower in NSCLC than in normal 
lung tissues. Positive rates of VM, Notch4, and DLL4 were positively associated
with tumor size, lymph node metastasis (LNM), distant metastasis (DM) and
tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage, and inversely with patients, overall survival 
(OS) time and positive rate of DLL4 were positively associated with tumor grade. 
Levels of KAI1/CD82 were negatively associated with tumor size, LNM, DM, and TNM 
stage. The KAI1/CD82+ subgroup had significantly longer OS time than did the
KAI1/CD82- subgroup. In multivariate analysis, high VM, Notch4, DLL4 levels,
tumor size, LNM, DM, TNM stage, and low KAI1/CD82 levels were potential to be
independent prognostic factors for overall survival time (OST) in NSCLC
patients.VM and the expression of Notch4, DLL4, and KAI1/CD82 represent promising
markers for tumor metastasis and prognosis, and maybe potential therapeutic
targets for NSCLC.

Background and aim: Adenocarcinoma is a very common pathological subtype for lung
cancer. We aimed to identify the gene signature associated with the prognosis of 
smoking related lung adenocarcinoma using bioinformatics analysis. Methods: A
total of five gene expression profiles (GSE31210, GSE32863, GSE40791, GSE43458
and GSE75037) have been identified from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)
database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were analyzed using GEO2R
software and functional and pathway enrichment analysis. Furthermore, the overall
survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) have been validated using an
independent cohort from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Results: We
identified a total of 58 DEGs which mainly enriched in ECM-receptor interaction, 
platelet activation and PPAR signaling pathway. Then according to the enrichment 
analysis results, we selected three genes (AURKA, CDC20 and TPX2) for their roles
in regulating tumor cell cycle and cell division. The results showed that the
hazard ratio (HR) of the mRNA expression of AURKA for OS was 1.588 with
(1.127-2.237) 95% confidence interval (CI) (P=0.009). The mRNA levels of CDC20
(HR 1.530, 95% CI 1.086-2.115, P=0.016) and TPX2 (HR 1.777, 95%CI 1.262-2.503,
P=0.001) were also significantly associated with the OS. Expression of these
three genes were not associated with RFS, suggesting that there might be many
factors affect RFS. Conclusion: The mRNA signature of AURKA, CDC20 and TPX2 were 
potential biomarkers for predicting poor prognosis of smoking related lung
adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Anlotinib has been demonstrated in clinical trials to be effective in
prolonging the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of
refractory advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients. However, the
underlying molecular mechanisms and predictive biomarkers of anlotinib are still 
unclear.
METHODS: A retrospective analysis of anlotinib administered to 294 NSCLC patients
was performed to screen for underlying biomarkers of anlotinib-responsive
patients. Transcriptome and functional assays were performed to understand the
antitumour molecular mechanisms of anlotinib. Changes in serum CCL2 levels were
analysed to examine the correlation of the anlotinib response between responders 
and nonresponders.
RESULTS: Anlotinib therapy was beneficial for prolonging OS in NSCLC patients
harbouring positive driver gene mutations, especially patients harbouring the
epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)T790M mutation. Moreover, anlotinib
inhibited angiogenesis in an NCI-H1975-derived xenograft model via inhibiting
CCL2. Finally, anlotinib-induced serum CCL2 level decreases were associated with 
the benefits of PFS and OS in refractory advanced NSCLC patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Our study reports a novel anti-angiogenesis mechanism of anlotinib
via inhibiting CCL2 in an NCI-H1975-derived xenograft model and suggests that
changes in serum CCL2 levels may be used to monitor and predict clinical outcomes
in anlotinib-administered refractory advanced NSCLC patients using third-line
therapy or beyond.

To study the relationship between Secreted protein, acidic and rich in cysteine
(SPARC), Transforming growth factorβ1 (TGFβ1), Endoglin and angiogenesis in lung 
cancer, 40 cases of lung cancer specimens and 40 adjacent normal lung tissues
specimens were collected and 10 cases from each were selected for preparation of 
tissue chip. CD34 (endothelial cell marker), Endoglin human α-Smooth muscle
actin, and (α-SMA) markers were performed by immunohistochemical staining, and
the immuno-phenotype and the relationship between different morphologies of the
microvascular wall components were evaluated. The expression of SPARC mRNA and
protein, TGFβ1 mRNA and protein and Endoglin in the remaining 30 cases of lung
cancer were detected by immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridization. The
result shows that the positive rates of SPARC, TGFβ1 and Endoglin in lung cancer 
tissues were significantly higher than those in adjacent normal lung tissues (P
less than 0.05). The expression of SPARC and TGFβ1 was negatively correlated with
lung cancer. When the positive expression of SPARC increased, the micro-vessel
density (MVD) marked by Endoglin decreased gradually; while the positive
expression of TGFβ1 increased, MVD increased gradually, and SPARC, TGFβ1 and MVD 
were correlated (P less than0.05). High SPARC mRNA expression in lung cancer
tissues could inhibit the progression of lung cancer, while high TGFβ1 mRNA
expression can promote the progression of lung cancer and participate in the
metastasis of lung cancer. To sum up, the angiogenesis of lung cancer may be
related to the interaction of SPARC, TGFβ1 and Endoglin.

Background: CXC chemokine receptor 7 (CXCR7) is frequently overexpressed in a
variety of tumors. Nevertheless, whether CXCR7 can be used as a tumor prognosis
marker has not been systematically assessed. The current meta-analysis was
performed to obtain an accurate evaluation of the relationship between CXCR7
level and the prognosis of cancer patients.
Methods: Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed were systematically searched
according to a defined search strategy up to June 11, 2018. Then, the required
data were extracted from all qualified studies which were screened out based on
the defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Finally, the hazard ratios (HR)
with 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used to evaluate the prognostic
significance of CXCR7 in tumor patients.
Results: A total of 28 original research studies comprising 33 cohorts and 5685
patients were included in this meta-analysis. The results showed that CXCR7
overexpression was significantly related to worse overall survival (OS) (HR 1.72;
95% CI 1.49-1.99), disease-free survival (DFS) (HR 5.58; 95% CI 3.16-9.85),
progression-free survival (PFS) (HR 2.83; 95% CI 1.66-4.85) and recurrence-free
survival (RFS) (HR 1.58; 95% CI 1.34-1.88) in cancer patients. Furthermore, for
certain types of cancer, significant associations between higher CXCR7 expression
and worse OS of glioma (HR 1.77; 95% CI 1.43-2.19), breast cancer (HR 1.45; 95%
CI 1.28-1.63), esophageal cancer (HR 2.72; 95% CI 1.11-6.66) and pancreatic
cancer (HR 1.46; 95% CI 1.12-1.90) were found. However, for lung cancer and
hepatocellular cancer, there was no significant relationship between CXCR7
expression level and OS, (HR 2.40; 95% CI 0.34-17.07) and (HR 1.37; 95% CI
0.84-2.24) respectively.
Conclusions: Increased CXCR7 level could predict poor prognosis of tumor patients
and might be regarded as a novel prognostic biomarker for tumor patients.

AIM: We investigated melanoma-associated antigen A1 (MAGE-A1) expression in lung 
cancer tissues and its correlation with prognostic factors.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, samples from 101 patients
with lung cancer were obtained between 2007 and 2014 and stained for MAGE-A1 by
immunohistochemistry. Correlation with prognostic factors was assessed by t test,
and χ 2 , and Pearson's tests.
RESULTS: Eighty non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and 21 small-cell lung cancer 
specimens were stained for MAGE-A1. MAGE-A1 was detected more commonly in
adenocarcinomas and was expressed more frequently in male and patients >60 years.
CONCLUSIONS: MAGE-A1 was found in several lung cancer patients. MAGE-A1 was
expressed more commonly in NSCLC, elderly, and men. Further investigations are
needed to assess MAGE-A1 as potential cancer biomarkers.

Although responses to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are initially
positive, 30%-40% of patients with EGFR-mutant tumors do not respond well to
EGFR-TKIs, and most lung cancer patients harboring EGFR mutations experience
relapse with resistance. Therefore, it is necessary to identify not only the
mechanisms underlying EGFR-TKI resistance, but also potentially novel therapeutic
targets and/or predictive biomarkers for EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma. We
found that the GPI-anchored protein semaphorin 7A (SEMA7A) is highly induced by
the EGFR pathway, via mTOR signaling, and that expression levels of SEMA7A in
human lung adenocarcinoma specimens were correlated with mTOR activation.
Investigations using cell culture and animal models demonstrated that loss or
overexpression of SEMA7A made cells less or more resistant to EGFR-TKIs,
respectively. The resistance was due to the inhibition of apoptosis by aberrant
activation of ERK. The ERK signal was suppressed by knockdown of integrin β1
(ITGB1). Furthermore, in patients with EGFR mutant tumors, higher SEMA7A
expression in clinical samples predicted poorer response to EGFR-TKI treatment.
Collectively, these data show that the SEMA7A-ITGB1 axis plays pivotal roles in
EGFR-TKI resistance mediated by ERK activation and apoptosis inhibition.
Moreover, our results reveal the potential utility of SEMA7A not only as a
predictive biomarker, but also as a potentially novel therapeutic target in
EGFR-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

Because of the refractory nature of mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) to
current therapies, identification of new molecular targets is essential. Genes
with a prognostic role in mutant KRAS LUAD have proven to be potential molecular 
targets for therapeutic development. Here we determine the clinical, functional, 
and mechanistic role of inhibitor of differentiation-1 (Id1) in mutant KRAS LUAD.
Analysis of LUAD cohorts from TCGA and SPORE showed that high expression of Id1
was a marker of poor survival in patients harboring mutant, but not wild-type
KRAS. Abrogation of Id1 induced G2-M arrest and apoptosis in mutant KRAS LUAD
cells. In vivo, loss of Id1 strongly impaired tumor growth and maintenance as
well as liver metastasis, resulting in improved survival. Mechanistically, Id1
was regulated by the KRAS oncogene through JNK, and loss of Id1 resulted in
downregulation of elements of the mitotic machinery via inhibition of the
transcription factor FOSL1 and of several kinases within the KRAS signaling
network. Our study provides clinical, functional, and mechanistic evidence
underscoring Id1 as a critical gene in mutant KRAS LUAD and warrants further
studies of Id1 as a therapeutic target in patients with LUAD. SIGNIFICANCE: These
findings highlight the prognostic significance of the transcriptional regulator
Id1 in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma and provide mechanistic insight into how
it controls tumor growth and metastasis.

Accumulating evidence indicates that miRNAs can be promising diagnostic and/or
prognostic markers for various cancers. In this study, we identified a novel
miRNA, miR-3607-3p, and its targets in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
expression of miR-3607-3p was measured and its correlation with patient prognosis
was determined. Ectopic expression in NSCLC cells, xenografts, and metastasis
models was used to evaluate the effects of miR-3607-3p on proliferation and
migration of NSCLC. Luciferase assay and western blotting were performed to
validate the potential targets of miR-3607-3p after preliminary screening by
microarray analysis and computer-aided algorithms. We demonstrated that
miR-3607-3p was downregulated in NSCLC tissues and that miR-3607-3p might act as 
an independent predictor for overall survival in NSCLC. Moreover, serum
miR-3607-3p may be a novel and stable marker for NSCLC. We found that
overexpression of miR-3607-3p inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation,
migration and invasion, and hampered the cell cycle of NSCLC cell lines in vitro.
Our results suggested that miR-3607-3p directly targets TGFBR1 and CCNE2. In
accordance with in vitro studies, we confirmed that miR-3607-3p functions as a
potent suppressor miRNA of NSCLC. We showed that miR-3607-3p agomir could reduce 
tumor growth and inhibit TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression. Taken together, our
findings indicate that miR-3607-3p can inhibit NSCLC cell growth and metastasis
by targeting TGFBR1 and CCNE2 protein expression, and provide new evidence of
miR-3607-3p as a potential non-invasive biomarker and therapeutic target for
NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Accumulating studies have reported that GLUT1 is aberrantly expressed
in lung cancer; nevertheless, the clinicopathologic significance and the
prognostic role of GLUT1 still remain controversial. The aim of this
meta-analysis was to identify the clinicopathologic and prognostic implications
of the GLUT1 expression in lung cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases with literature published in English, including 
Cochrane Library, Embase, Web of Science, and PubMed, and the China National
Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and WanFang database in Chinese were searched
comprehensively for relevant studies in August 2017. The pooled odds ratio (OR)
or hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated to
evaluate the clinicopathologic significance and prognostic value of GLUT1 in lung
cancer.
RESULTS: A total of 26 studies (2653 cases) were included in the current study.
Totally, 1423 patients from nineteen studies were included to assess the
relationships between GLUT1 and clinicopathological parameters, the pooled OR
indicated that positive GLUT1 expression was significantly related with
classification (adenocarcinomas vs. squamous carcinomas, OR = 0.276, 95% CIs:
0.117-0.651, P = 0.003), tumor differentiation (G3-4 vs. G2~1, OR = 1.944, 95%
CIs: 1.384-2.730; P < 0.001), lymph node metastasis (positive vs. negative,
OR = 3.65, 95% CIs: 1.82-7.32, P < 0.001),tumor size (large tumor size vs. small 
tumor size, OR = 2.03, 95% CI: 1.42-2.91, P < 0.001), and advanced tumor stages
(OR = 2.527, 95% CIs: 1.325-4.820). Regarding the significance of GLUT1 in the
overall survival (OS) of lung cancer, the pooled HRs with 1731 lung cancer
patients was 1.41 (P = 0.002; 95% CIs: 1.13-1.76). Additionally, the
overexpression of GLUT1 could significantly predict the shorter disease-free
survival (HR = 1.68, 95% CIs: 1.01-2.79) and disease-specific survival
(HR = 1.59, 95% CIs: 1.11-2.29).
CONCLUSIONS: A positive expression of GLUT1 significantly predicts a poor
prognosis in lung cancer patients. GLUT1 may server as a helpful biomarker and a 
potential target for the treatment strategies of lung cancer.

sensitizing EGFR mutations. Unfortunately, 10-30% patients do not show objective 
responses to EGFR-TKIs, and undergo rapid disease progression during the
EGFR-TKIs therapy. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in mature microRNA
(miRNA) sequences may influence target site interactions and modulate downstream 
pathways, such as the EGFR pathway. For this reason, we hypothesized that miRNA
SNPs may impact the prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients after EGFR-TKI
treatment. By systematically screening of the miRbase and the 1000 genomes
project databases, we successfully identified five mature miRNA SNPs. Genotypes
were determined in two independent cohorts (Hubei and Shandong cohorts) that
include 319 EGFR-TKI treated stage IIIB/IV patients. The impact of miR-608 and
miR-4513 on the drug sensitivity of gefitinib was examined in lung adenocarcinoma
cells. miR-608 rs4919510 or miR-4513 rs2168518 significantly contributed to the
progression-free survival (PFS) in the Hubei cohort (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.63,
confidence interval [CI] = 0.49-0.81, P = 3.0 × 10-4 or HR = 0.46, 95%
CI = 0.31-0.67, P = 8.0 × 10-5). These observations were further validated in the
Shandong cohort (P = 0.005 or P = 0.001). Similarly, the miR-608 rs4919510 CC
genotype or the miR-4513 rs2168518 GA genotype was significantly associated with 
decreased death risk after gefitinib treatment, compared with the rs4919510 GG
genotype (Hubei cohort: P = 5.0 × 10-4; Shandong cohort: P = 0.004) or the
rs2168518 GG genotype (P = 4.9 × 10-5; P = 0.002). Consistently, miR-608
significantly increased the anti-proliferation effect of gefitinib in both lung
adenocarcinoma PC9 and H1299 cells, whereas miR-4513 increased cells' resistance 
to gefitinib. Our findings suggest that miR-608 and miR-4513 SNPs are independent
candidate biomarkers to predict lung adenocarcinoma patients' survival after
EGFR-TKIs treatment. These miRNAs and polymorphisms provide clinical potential in
patient-tailored treatment decision-making.

Serine protease inhibitor Kazal type 1 (SPINK1) plays a role in protecting the
pancreas against premature activation of trypsinogen and is involved in cancer
progression. SPINK1 promoted LAC cells growth, migration, and invasion.
Mechanistically, we found that SPINK1 promoted LAC cells migration and invasion
via up-regulating matrix metalloproteinase 12 (MMP12). We observed that SPINK1
expression was only up-regulated in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) tissues, and was an
independent prognostic factor for poor survival. Our results indicate that SPINK1
might be a potential biomarker for LAC that promotes progression by MMP12. [BMB

The introduction of EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) has revolutionized the
treatment and prognosis of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients harboring 
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutations. However, these patients
display disease progression driven by the onset of acquired mechanisms of drug
resistance that limit the efficacy of EGFR-TKI to no longer than one year.
Moreover, a small fraction of EGFR-mutated NSCLC patients does not benefit from
this targeted treatment due to primary (i.e. intrinsic) mechanisms of resistance 
that preexist prior to TKI drug treatment. Research efforts are focusing on
deciphering the distinct molecular mechanisms underlying drug resistance, which
should prompt the development of novel antitumor agents that surmount such
chemoresistance modalities. The capability of microRNAs (miRNAs) to regulate the 
expression of many oncogenic pathways and their central role in lung cancer
progression, provided new directions for research on prognostic biomarkers, as
well as innovative tools for predicting patients' response to systemic therapies.
Recent evidence suggests that modulation of key miRNAs may also reverse oncogenic
signaling pathways, and potentiate the cytotoxic effect of anti-cancer therapies.
In this review, we focus on the putative emerging role of miRNAs in modulating
drug resistance to EGFR-TKI treatment in EGFR-mutated NSCLC. Moreover, we discuss
the current implications of miRNAs analyses in the clinical setting, using both
tissue and liquid biopsies, as well as the future potential use of miRNA-based
therapies in overcoming resistance to targeted agents like TKIs.

PURPOSE: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a
variety of cancers. Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and
prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers.
METHODS: Over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database were analyzed to determine the
distribution of germline and somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. Subsequently,
7,893 cancer cases were compiled in cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33
most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of
TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival
times.
RESULTS: The data were analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53
mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 
248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of
codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33
TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in
nine cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and
thymoma) for survival time and in five cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma)
for disease-free survival time. It was also found that the most common p53
mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for
poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole. In addition, in cases of ovarian
serous cystadenocarcinoma, the co-occurrence of TP53 and BRCA mutations resulted 
in longer survival and disease-free survival times than the presence of neither
TP53 nor BRCA mutations.
CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to
further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival
times of cancer patients.

Pectolinarigenin inhibits non‑small cell lung cancer progression by regulating
the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway.

Lung cancer is the principal cause of cancer‑-associated mortality.
Pectolinarigenin (Pec) reportedly has effective antitumor activity against
certain cancer types. Phosphatase and tensin homolog (PTEN) is a well‑known tumor
suppressor and serves a vital role in cancer progression. However, the effect of 
Pec on non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell proliferation and metastasis, and 
the underlying mechanism, has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, it
was demonstrated that Pec inhibited the proliferation of A549 and Calu‑3 cells in
dose‑ and time‑dependent manners. The apoptosis rate significantly increased with
increasing doses of Pec. Apoptosis‑associated protein expression was additionally
altered by Pec exposure. Pec was able to suppress the metastasis of NSCLC cells; 
it upregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of E‑cadherin, and
downregulated the mRNA and protein expression levels of vimentin. Additionally,
Pec was able to activate PTEN and subsequently downregulate the PI3K/protein
kinase B (AKT) signaling pathway. In summary, Pec was able to inhibit cell
proliferation, promote apoptosis and suppress metastasis in NSCLC cells through
the PTEN/PI3K/AKT signaling pathway, indicating that Pec is a potential agent for
NSCLC therapy.

Lung cancer initiating cells represent a specific subpopulation of lung cancer
cells, which significantly contribute to the initiation, metastasis and
recurrence of lung cancer. CD133, initially considered a marker of stem cells, is
now considered as a marker for lung cancer initiating cells. All-trans retinoic
acid (RA) has been demonstrated to cause the differentiation, inhibition of
proliferation, and apoptosis of cancer cells and cancer initiating cells.
However, there have been no reports on the activity of RA against lung cancer
initiating cells. In the present study, the activity of RA against lung cancer
initiating cells was investigated by determining the cytotoxicity, and performing
a tumorsphere assay and flow cytometry-based analysis. In addition, to promote
the therapeutic effect of RA in CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells, RA-loaded
lipid poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles with CD133 aptamers
(RA-LPNPs-CD133) were developed. The activity of RA and RA-LPNPs-CD133 against
lung cancer initiating cells was also investigated. RA-LPNPs-CD133 had a size of 
129.9 nm, and exhibited sustained release of RA during the 144-h period. For the 
first time, to the best of our knowledge, the present study demonstrated that RA 
exerted potent activity towards CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells. The results 
also showed that RA-LPNPs-CD133 efficiently and specifically promoted the
delivery of RA to CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells, exhibiting superior
inhibitory effects against CD133+ lung cancer initiating cells compared with
non-targeted nanoparticles and RA. To the best of our knowledge, the present
study is the first to report the promotion of RA delivery via nanoparticles to
lung cancer initiating cells and achievement of a superior inhibitory effect
against lung cancer initiating cells by the utilization of CD133 aptamers.
Therefore, RA-LPNPs-CD133 represents a promising tool for the elimination of lung
cancer initiating cells.

Aims: The association between forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) and survival of nonsmall
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been extensively investigated. However, the results 
were conflicted and inconclusive. Therefore, we performed this meta-analysis to
precisely estimate the association between FOXM1 and survival of NSCLC.
Materials and Methods: Studies were searched using the PubMed and EMBASE. The
strength of the association was calculated with the hazard ratios (HRs) and
respective 95% confidence intervals (CIs).
Results: Result of this meta-analysis showed that high expression of FOXM1 was
significantly associated with shorter overall survival (OS) of NSCLC (HR = 1.82; 
95% CI 1.45-2.29). In the stratified analysis by country, we found that the
expression of FOXM1 was significantly associated with shorter OS in Chinese NSCLC
patients (HR = 1.82; 95% CI 1.45-2.29). In addition, high expression of FOXM1
decreased the OS in patients with surgery (HR = 1.88; 95% CI 1.37-2.58).
Furthermore, the results were still positive in both large sample size studies
and small sample size studies.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis showed that overexpression of FOXM1 might be
associated with shorter OS of NSCLC patients.

Background: Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are responsible for tumor relapse after
chemotherapy and radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The aim of
this study is to explore the profile and role of microRNA (miRNA) in CSC of
NSCLC.
Materials and Methods: We studied the expression of stem cell marker in side
population cells and serum-free cultured spheres of NSCLC. We identified that
CD133+ CD34- cells are NSCLC stem cell. We isolated CD133+ CD34- cells and CD133-
CD34+ cells with MicroBead Kit. We verified that H1650 CD133+ CD34- cells have
CSC characteristics with doxorubicin, radiation, and xenograft. We studied miRNA 
expression profile in H1650 and HCC827 CD133+ CD34- cells with microarray
analysis. We detected proliferation, migration, and invasion with
3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide assay, scratch test,
and Transwell chamber invasion assay, respectively.
Results: CD133 and CD34 are CSC markers in H1650. We demonstrated that H1650
CD133+ CD34- cells have CSC characteristics and found that miR-27a was highly
expressed in H1650 CD133+ CD34- cells. In addition, we showed that miR-27a
regulates proliferation, migration, and invasion in H1650 cell line and
demonstrated that miR-27a expression was positively related to epidermal growth
factor receptor in NSCLC cell lines.
Conclusions: CD133+ CD34- is a CSC marker in H1650. miR-27a is highly expressed
in H1650 CSCs and regulates cancer development in H1650. miR-27a may be a
potential target for NSCLC therapy.

Son of sevenless (SOS) is one of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors that can
regulate the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal regulated
kinase signal pathway via controlling the activation of Ras. microRNAs are key
regulon of gene expression and would be treated as tumor biomarkers or
therapeutic targets. In this study, we find that miR-148a-3p acts as a
tumor-suppressor in the development and progression of non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). miR-148a-3p inhibits NSCLC cells proliferation and
epithelial-mesenchymal transition by reducing the expression of SOS2, which
refers Ras activating. Our findings demonstrate that the miR-148a-3p may play a
significant role in NSCLC including the kind of lung cancer with K-Ras gene
mutation, and it exerted the tumor inhibitor function by targeting SOS2. Because 
of that, miR-148a-3p and SOS2 may be an efficient target in developing more
useful therapies against NSCLC.

Emerging evidences have revealed tumor-specific gene methylation is considered to
be a promising non-invasive biomarker for many different types of cancers. This
study was determined whether TMEM196 gene hypermethylation and downregulation are
considered to be promising biomarkers for early diagnosis and prognosis in lung
cancer. Methylation status was detected with methylation-specific PCR.
Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox regression analysis were used to determine
the significance of prognosis. TMEM196 gene was hypermethylated in 68.1% (64/94) 
of lung cancer tissues, 52.8% (67/127) of plasma and 55.2% (79/143) of sputum
samples, but unmethylated (0/50) in normal tissues. TMEM196 methylation in plasma
and sputum samples was significantly correlated with that in the corresponding
paired tumor tissues (r = 0.750, r = 0.880, P < 0.001). TMEM196 aberrant
methylation in cancer tissues, plasma and sputum DNA was significantly associated
with age and pathological type (P < 0.05). TMEM196 high methylation could
robustly distinguish lung cancer patients (AUC = 0.905) from normal subjects and 
patients with TMEM196 high methylation have a significantly poorer survival than 
those with low level from The Cancer Genome Atlas (Wilcoxon P < 0.001).
Multivariate models showed TMEM196 methylation is an independent prognostic
marker in lung cancer. Furthermore, the overall survival of patients with low
TMEM196 expression was significantly poorer than that of TMEM196-high patients
(P < 0.001, log-rank test). Low TMEM196 expression in tumor tissues was found to 
predict poorer survival (HR = 3.007; 95%CI, 1.918-4.714). Our study provided new 
insights into the clinical importance and potential use of TMEM196 methylation
and expression as novel early diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers for human lung
cancers.

miR-582-5p is a potential prognostic marker in human non-small cell lung cancer
and functions as a tumor suppressor by targeting MAP3K2.

OBJECTIVE: Emerging evidence has shown that microRNAs (miRNAs) play important
roles in tumor development and progression. The aim of the present study was to
investigate the role of miR-582-5p in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to
determine the molecular mechanisms underlying its action.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using quantitative RT-PCR, we detected miR-582-5p
expression in NSCLC cell lines and primary tumor tissues. The association of
miR-582-5p expression with clinicopathological factors and prognosis was
statistically analyzed. The effect of miR-582-5p on proliferation was evaluated
by CCK-8. Cell migration and invasion were assessed by transwell assay.
miR-582-5p target genes were confirmed using luciferase activity, RT-PCR and
Western blot assays.
RESULTS: We found that miR-582-5p expression was significantly downregulated in
NSCLC cell lines and clinical specimens. Low miR-582-5p expression was
significantly associated with lymph node metastasis (p = 0.012) and advanced TNM 
stage (p = 0.004). Kaplan-Meier assay showed that patients with low expression of
miR-582-5p had a shorter overall survival than those with high expression of
miR-582-5p (p = 0.0033). Functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression 
of miR-582-5p suppressed the proliferation, migration and invasion of NSCLC cells
in vitro. We identified MAP3K2 as a direct target gene of miR-582-5p in NSCLC
cells. In addition, ectopic expression of MAP3K2 restored the effects of
miR-582-5p on NSCLC cell proliferation, migration and invasion.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that miR-582-5p inhibits NSCLC metastasis by targeting
MAP3K2 expression and could be used as an independent prognostic biomarker for
patients with NSCLC.

Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1) is overexpressed in up to 95% of primary
lung adenocarcinoma while negative for almost all squamous cell carcinomas. TTF-1
expression has been investigated as a prognostic factor in non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) with conflicting results. We conducted this meta-analysis to gain 
a better insight into the prognostic role of TTF-1 in patients only with
non-squamous (non-SQ) NSCLC. A systematic computerized search of the electronic
databases including PubMed, PMC, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library was
performed. From 21 studies, 6,451 patients were included in the combined analysis
of hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for overall survival. 
Compared with patients with non-SQ NSCLC showing negative TTF-1 expression, those
with tumors harboring TTF-1 overexpression had significantly better survival (HR 
= 0.49, 95% CI: 0.42-0.57, p < 0.00001). Subgroup analyses revealed that TTF-1
expression significantly correlated with a better prognosis in stage I (HR =
0.65, 95% CI: 0.50-0.84, p = 0.0008) as well as stage III-IV non-SQ NSCLC (HR =
0.38, 95% CI: 0.29-0.49, p < 0.00001). In conclusion, this meta-analysis
demonstrates that TTF-1 overexpression is a favorable prognostic factor in
patients with non-SQ NSCLC. The subgroup analyses indicate that TTF-1 is a good
prognostic marker for survival not only in early-stage but also in advanced
non-SQ NSCLC.

BACKGROUND/AIM: While the PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx assay is an FDA-approved diagnostic 
assay for pembrolizumab use, not every pathology laboratory has the Dako
Autostainer to use this assay. Since Ventana BenchMark platforms are more common,
the Ventana SP263 assay can be used to inform treatment decisions involving
nivolumab and pembrolizumab in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, some 
studies have shown discordant results between the two assays. This study aimed
was to compare PD-L1 expression using these two assays.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 100 samples from consecutive cases of resected 
NSCLC were tested using the two PD-L1 assays.
RESULTS: The agreement rates of the two assays were 88-97% at various cut-offs.
There was no significant difference between 22C3 and SP263 in tumour proportion
score (p=0.455).
CONCLUSION: The SP263 assay can be used in the place of the 22C3 assay for PD-L1 
testing, for guiding therapy with PD-1 axis inhibitors in NSCLC.

Gefitinib, an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor
(EGFR-TKI), is used clinically as first-line therapy in patients with advanced
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with EGFR activating mutations, but the
inevitable development of acquired resistance limits its efficacy. In up to
30-40% of NSCLC cases, the mechanism underlying acquired resistance remains
unknown. ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters are a family of membrane
proteins that can significantly influence the bioavailability of numerous drugs, 
and have confirmed to play an essential role in multidrug resistance (MDR) in
cancer chemotherapy. However, their role in acquired resistance to gefitnib in
NSCLC has not been well studied. Here, through RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq)
technology we assessed the differentially expressed ABC transporters in
gefitinib-sensitive (PC9 and H292) and gefitinib-resistant (PC9/GR and H292/GR)
NSCLC cells, with ABCC10 identified as a transporter of interest. Both ABCC10
mRNA and protein were significantly increased in acquired gefitinib-resistant
NSCLC cells, independent of EGFR mutation status. In vitro transport assay showed
that ABCC10 could actively efflux gefitinib, with an efflux ratio (ER) of 7.8.
Further results from in vitro cell line models and in vivo xenograft models
showed that overexpression of ABCC10 led to a reduction in gefitinib sensitivity 
through decreasing the intracellular gefitinib accumulation. Our data suggest
that ABCC10 has an important role in acquired resistance to gefitinib in NSCLC,
which can serve as a novel predictive marker and a potential therapeutic target
in gefitinib treatment.

BACKGROUND: Different histological subtypes of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
show different molecular characteristics and responses to therapeutic strategy.
Identification of specific gene, clarification of its special roles and molecular
mechanisms are crucial for developing new therapeutic approach for particular
subtype patients.
METHODS: Surgical specimens of 540 NSCLC patients were recruited.
Immunohistochemistry was used to detect SOX30 expression, and correlations with
clinical parameters were analyzed. Functional experiments and gene ontology
analysis were performed to investigate roles of SOX30. Network analysis,
TOP/FOP-Flash assays, luciferase reporter assays and ChIP-PCR assays were
performed to determine the mechanism. Survival analyses were calculated by
Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression. Recovery experiment was investigated the
importance of the target of SOX30.
RESULTS: SOX30 expression is closely associated with histological types of NSCLC,
and metastasis of adenocarcinoma (ADC) patients but not of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) patients. SOX30 strongly inhibits cancer cell migration and
invasion in ADC cell lines, whrereas not affects cell migration and invasion in
SCC cell lines. The genes associated with SOX30 preferentially enrich in
metastasis process and Wnt-signaling in only ADC patients. Consistently, SOX30 is
negatively associated with the expression of Wnt-signaling and metastasis-related
gene CTNNB1 (β-catenin) in ADC, but not in SCC. At the molecular level, SOX30
represses Wnt-signaling by directly transcriptional inhibition of CTNNB1 in ADC, 
and also not in SCC. In the clinical, SOX30 is a favorable and independent
prognostic factor in ADC patients, whereas is an unfavorable and independent
prognostic factor in SCC patients. Moreover, SOX30 expression is a double face
early-stage prognostic biomarker in ADC and SCC patients. In addition, forcible
restoration of CTNNB1 indeed can inhibit the anti-metastatic role of SOX30 in ADC
patients.
CONCLUSIONS: In early-stage ADC patients, elevated SOX30 expression inhibits
tumor-metastasis by directly binding to CTNNB1 promoter resulting in a favorable 
prognosis of these patients. However, in early-stage SCC patients, SOX30 has no
inhibitory role on tumor-metastasis due to not binding to CTNNB1 promoter leading
to an unfavorable prognosis of the patients. This study highlights a special role
and prognostic value of SOX30 in ADC, providing a novel therapeutic target for
particular subtype NSCLC patients.

Purpose: To identify and clarify the roles of inflammatory markers in prognosis
for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with EGFR
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI).
Patients and methods: One hundred and twelve adenocarcinoma, clinical stage IV,
NSCLC patients with either EGFR exon 19 deletion (E19del) or EGFR exon 21 L858R
substitution mutation (L858R) were selected for this study. The blood cell count 
at different stages of treatment was used to calculate the inflammatory markers. 
The Kaplan-Meier statistics and Cox regression model were used to test the
differences of progression-free survival (PFS) between groups by the optimal
cutoff point of biomarkers.
Results: The median values of white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil to lymphocyte
ratio (NLR), monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio 
(PLR) in NSCLC patients tended to be reduced after 3 months treated with EGFR TKI
and increased conversely when the disease develops progression (P<0.001). With an
optimal cutoff point of 2.96, NLR is the best prognostic marker in prediction of 
clinical response among the investigated markers (area under the curve
[AUC]=0.873, 95% CI: 0.821-0.926, P<0.001), and it is an independent predictive
marker (OR=3.52, 95% CI: 1.42-8.71, P<0.001). With optimal cutoff point of 0.38, 
MLR is also a predictive marker in response evaluation (AUC=0.762, 95% CI:
0.691-0.832). Univariate analyses have shown that the larger tumor size (>3cm)
and the high level of pretreatment NLR were associated with the shortening of PFS
(HR=2.24, 95% CI: 1.04-4.83, P=0.039 and HR=2.67, 95% CI: 1.41-5.03, P=0.006,
respectively). Multivariate analysis has shown that the elevated NLR is an
independent prognostic marker for worse PFS of NSCLC patients treated with EGFR
TKI (HR=2.15, 95% CI: 1.15-3.99, P=0.016).
Conclusion: NLR and MLR are valuable markers in response evaluation for NSCLC
patients treated with EGFR TKI. The elevated NLR is also an independent
prognostic factor for worse survival.

Background: TRIM37 is an ubiquitin E3 ligase. Growing evidence has demonstrated
the high value of TRIM37 as a potential biomarker for diagnosis of certain
cancers. However, the biological function of TRIM37 in lung cancer is still
unknown.
Materials and methods: In order to gain a deep insight into the function of
TRIM37 in lung cancer cells, in the present study lentiviral vector was used to
mediate RNA interference and overexpression of TRIM37 in lung cancer cells (H292,
H358, and H1299). In addition, a specific AKT inhibitor LY294002 was utilized to 
examine the correlation between the expression of TRIM37 and AKT.
Results: TRIM37 acts as a positive regulator of cell proliferation in lung cancer
cells. Moreover, cell apoptosis analyses showed the antiapoptosis function of
TRIM37, which was mainly dependent on the regulation of BCL2 and BAX. Our results
also indicated that AKT might be a target of TRIM37 in lung cancer cells.
Conclusion: This research not only helps in understanding the molecular
mechanisms of TRIM37 in detail but also provides evidence to develop novel
biomarkers for lung cancer diagnosis.

Non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for the majority of the lung cancer
cases that have become a leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. Overexpression
of transcription factor forkhead box M1 (FOXM1) is involved in the inauspicious
development of several types of cancer, including lung tumor aggressiveness. Our 
laboratory has previously found that MED28, a Mediator subunit for
transcriptional activation, modulates cell growth, epithelial-mesenchymal
transition, migration, and invasion in human breast cancer cells. The objective
of the current study is to investigate the potential role of MED28 and FOXM1 in
NSCLC. In addition to A549 and PC9 cells, we also used a doxycycline-inducible
system to generate FOXM1-overexpressed A549-DN cells, and we explored the
connection of MED28 with FOXM1 and their effect on migration. Herein, we report
that the increased expression levels of both MED28 and FOXM1 elevated the
expression of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2), a metastasis marker, which
enhanced cell migration and matrigel invasion of NSCLC cells. Furthermore, MED28 
interacted with FOXM1, and both exhibited a mutual effect on the expression and
subcellular localization. Moreover, MED28 small interfering RNA-mediated MMP2
gene suppression could be attenuated by inducible expression of a constitutively 
active form of FOXM1, which consequently restored the migration and invasion
ability of NSCLC cells. Our data indicate that MED28 interacts with FOXM1, and
each affects the expression and localization of the other, and, more importantly,
both regulate MMP2-dependent migration and invasion in human lung cancer cells.

BACKGROUND: Either chronic or acute exposure to dust particles may lead to
pneumoconiosis and lung cancer, and lung cancer mortality among patients
diagnosed with pneumoconiosis is increasing. Utilizing genome-wide sequencing
technology, this study aimed to identify methods to decrease the number of
patients with pneumoconiosis who die from lung cancer.
METHODS: One hundred fifty-four subjects were recruited, including 54
pneumoconiosis patients and 100 healthy controls. Exosomes were isolated from the
venous blood of every subject. Distinctive miRNAs were identified using high
throughput sequencing technology, and bioinformatics analysis predicted target
genes involved in lung cancer as well as their corresponding biological
functions. Moreover, cross-cancer alterations of genes related to lung cancer
were investigated, and survival analysis was performed using 2437 samples with an
average follow-up period of 49 months.
RESULTS: Let-7a-5p was revealed to be downregulated by 21.67% in pneumoconiosis. 
Out of the 683 let-7a-5p target genes identified from bioinformatics analysis,
four genes related to five signaling pathways were confirmed to be involved in
lung cancer development. Alterations in these four target genes were then
explored in 4105 lung cancer patients, and BCL2L1 and IGF1R were demonstrated to 
be aberrantly expressed. Survival analysis further revealed that high expression 
of BCL2L1 corresponded to reduced survival of lung cancer patients (HR
(95%CI) = 1.75(1.33~2.30)), while patient survival time was unaffected by
expression of IGF1R (HR (95%CI) = 1.15 (0.98~1.36)).
CONCLUSIONS: In patients with lung adenocarcinoma, simultaneous downregulation of
exosomal let-7a-5p and elevated expression of BCL2L1 are useful as predictive
biomarkers for poor survival.

BACKGROUND: Older adults with lung cancer often have comorbidities that may
increase risk of symptomatic adverse events (AEs) and physical function decline. 
The objective of this study was to examine age-related differences in
patient-reported symptoms and functional domains in patients with advanced lung
cancer receiving immunotherapy drugs.
METHODS: Three randomized controlled trials of anti-programmed death
receptor-1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy in patients with advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer that included patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were identified. 
Baseline PRO data were pooled for treatment arms from 2 trials that included the 
same PRO tools. Age-related differences in baseline mean scores for each of the
health-related quality of life functional and symptom scales were assessed for
patients ≥70 years and <70 years. Mean change from Baseline at 3 months was also 
calculated and plotted for each age group. The adequacy of PRO assessments was
assessed by comparing clinician-reported AE data in the 3 trials to the item
content of the PRO tools included.
RESULTS: Across the 3 trials, 75 of patients were under 70 and 26% patients were 
70 and older. Comparing baseline scores in the 2 trials with the same PRO tool,
older adults reported small differences including lower physical functioning,
less pain, insomnia and financial difficulties, and higher social functioning
than younger patients at baseline. No large differences in the distributions of
mean change from baseline in function or symptom were identified. Several common 
clinician-reported symptomatic AEs were not assessed by the PRO strategy employed
in the 3 trials. Three clinician-reported symptomatic AEs (rash, fever, and
pruritus) that were commonly reported in the safety data (9%-19%) were not
assessed using the PRO tools employed.
CONCLUSION: While several small differences were seen, there did not appear to be
large differences at baseline or in the distributions of change from baseline in 
PRO functional domains between younger and older patients with lung cancer
undergoing anti-programmed death receptor -1/programmed death-ligand 1 therapy.
Relevant symptomatic side effects were not assessed by PRO measures in these
trials, and this is a limitation of current PRO assessment strategies.

KIAA1199 is often upregulated in cancer cells, including non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Although KIAA1199 is associated with aggressive tumor phenotype
and poor survival in NSCLC, little is known about its functional role in NSCLC
progression. Using archived clinical samples, we evaluated KIAA1199 messenger RNA
(mRNA) and protein expression in NSCLC tissues and correlated with NSCLC
clinicopathological characteristics as well as overall survival. Using NSCLC cell
lines, KIAA1199 was either silenced using gene-specific shRNA or overexpressed to
assess the impact on EMT signaling pathways. Finally, in a mouse xenograft NSCLC 
model, we determine the therapeutic potential of KIAA1199 repression. Our data
showed that KIAA1199 was significantly upregulated in NSCLC tissues compared to
adjacent normal tissues both at the mRNA (P < 0.001) and protein levels
(P < 0.05). KIAA1199 overexpression is an independent prognostic marker for
overall survival (HR = 1.833). In NSCLC cell lines, KIAA1199 expression directly 
influences the expression of EMT markers, EMT-inducing transcription factors
(EMT-TFs), and EMT signaling molecules. Knocking down of KIAA1199 expression in
the mouse NSCLC xenograft model significantly suppressed tumor growth and
augmented the efficacy of chemotherapy (n = 5; P < 0.05). We conclude that
KIAA1199 is not only a prognostic marker but a novel therapeutic target in NSCLC 
through regulating EMT signaling pathway. KEY MESSAGES: KIAA1199 overexpression
is an independent prognostic marker in NSCLC. KIAA1199 expression directly
influences the expression of EMT markers. KIAA1199 promotes invasion and
migration in NSCLC via PI3K-Akt mediated EMT.

PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of microRNA-129 on the migration and invasion 
in (Non small cell lung cancer) NSCLC cells and involved mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A549 cells were cultured and transfected with microRNA-129
(miR-129) mimic. Wound-healing assay and transwell assay were used to analyses
the migration and invasion of A549 cells, respectively. The SOX4 expression
changes were detected by qRT-PCR and Western blot. Dual-luciferase reporter assay
was used to determine the binding site between miR-129 and the 3'-UTR of SOX4.
A549 cells, miR-129 up-regulated A549 cells and miR-129 + SOX4 up-regulated A549 
cells were treated with TGF-β in order to induce the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The miR-129 and SOX4 after TGF-β treatment were measured. The
EMT markers level changes were detected by western blot.
RESULTS: Up-regulation of miR-129 significantly inhibited the migration and
invasion of A549 cells. miR-129 mimic transfection could reduce the mRNA and
protein level of SOX4. Dual-luciferase reporter assay showed that miR-129 could
bind to the 3'-UTR of SOX4. TGF-β induced EMT accompanied by the reduction of
miR-129 and elevating of SOX4. Up-regulation of miR-129 could reverse the EMT
marker changes caused by TGF-β, however, the SOX4 overexpression antagonized this
effect of miR-129.
CONCLUSIONS: miR-129 could suppress the migration and invasion of A549 cells. The
potential mechanism may be that miR-129 inhibit EMT via targeting SOX4.

BACKGROUND: Anti-programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) antibodies have demonstrated
improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) in a subset of
patients with metastatic or locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). 
To date, no blood biomarkers have been identified in NSCLC to predict clinical
outcomes of treatment with anti-PD-1 antibodies.
PATIENT AND METHODS: We performed an analysis of retrospectively registered data 
of 157 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-1 antibodies at Mayo
Clinic in Florida and Rochester. White blood cell count, absolute neutrophil
count (ANC), absolute lymphocyte count (ALC), ANC to ALC (ANC: ALC) ratio,
absolute eosinophil count, absolute monocyte count (AMC), platelet counts, and
myeloid to lymphoid (M:L) ratio at baseline and throughout treatment were
assessed. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazards model were performed.
RESULTS: We treated 146 patients with nivolumab and 11 with pembrolizumab between
January 1, 2015 and April 15, 2017. At median follow-up of 20 months, median OS
and PFS were 6.0 and 2.6 months, respectively. Higher baseline ANC, AMC, ANC: ALC
ratio and M: L ratio correlated with worse clinical outcomes in patients who
underwent anti-PD-1 treatment. A baseline ANC: ALC ratio of 5.9 or higher had a
significantly increased risk of death (hazard ratio [HR] =1.94; 95% confidence
interval [CI], 1.24-3.03; P = 0.004) and disease progression (HR, 1.65; 95% CI,
1.17-2.34; P = 0.005) compared with patients with lower ratio. Similarly, a
baseline M: L ratio of 11.3 or higher had significantly increased risk of death
(HR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.54-4.05; P < 0.001), even after a multivariate analysis (HR, 
2.31; P = 0.002), compared to those with lower ratio.
CONCLUSIONS: Increased baseline ANC: ALC ratio and M: L ratio before initiation
of anti-PD1 antibodies were associated with poor PFS and OS in advanced NSCLC
patients. The potential predictive value of these readily available biomarkers
might help with risk stratification and treatment strategies. These findings
warrant further investigation in a larger, prospective study.

Purpose: Radiotherapy is a major treatment method for patients with non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the presence of radioresistant cancer stem
cells (CSCs) may be associated with disease relapse or a poor outcome after
radiotherapy. Voltage-gated calcium channel α2δ1 subunit (encoded by the gene
CACNA2D1) isoform 5 is a marker of CSCs in hepatocellular carcinoma. This study
aimed to investigate the radiosensitivity of α2δ1-high cells in NSCLC cell lines.
Materials and methods: NSCLC cell lines A549, H1975, H1299, and PC9 were used.
CACNA2D1-knockdown and CACNA2D1-overexpressing cell lines were established by
lentiviral infection. Colony formation assay was performed to determine
radiosensitivity. Sphere formation assay in serum-free medium was performed to
evaluate self-renewal capacity. Proteins associated with DNA damage repair were
analyzed by immunofluorescence or Western blot. The monoclonal antibody of α2δ1
was applied alone or in combination with radiation either in vitro or in vivo to 
determine the anti-tumor effect of the antibody.
Results: α2δ1-high cells showed greater sphere-forming efficiency than α2δ1-low
cells and were relatively resistant to radiation. CACNA2D1 knockdown in A549
cells enhanced radiosensitivity, whereas CACNA2D1 overexpression in PC9 and H1975
cells reduced radiosensitivity, suggesting that α2δ1 imparted radioresistance to 
NSCLC cells. Analysis of proteins involved in DNA damage repair suggested that
α2δ1 enhanced the efficiency of DNA damage repair. The monoclonal antibody of
α2δ1 had a synergistic effect with that of radiation to block the self-renewal of
α2δ1-high cells and enhanced the radiosensitivity of α2δ1-positive cells in
colony formation assays. The combination of the α2δ1 antibody with radiation
repressed A549 xenograft growth in vivo.
Conclusion: α2δ1 enhances radioresistance in cancer stem-like cells in NSCLC. The
α2δ1 monoclonal antibody sensitizes α2δ1-high cells to radiation, suggesting that
the antibody may be used to improve the treatment outcome when combined with
radiation in NSCLC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the malignant tumors with highest
mortality in the world, it is still a difficult problem in clinical field. Its
occurrence and development are closely associated with tumor angiogenesis.
Angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) is an important angiogenesis factor that has involved in
many researches and it has been confirmed that the expression of Ang-2 is
significantly up-regulated in tissues and blood of NSCLC. Meanwhile, Ang-2 is
related to malignant biological behavior of cancer cells, making it a potential


biological marker for the diagnosis and prognosis of NSCLC. At present,
researches on Ang-2 how to promote the progression of NSCLC around the world are 
focused on Ang-2 regulating the proliferation, invasion, and metastasis of NSCLC.
This paper summarized and estimated the studies and literature reports of
regulatory mechanisms of Ang-2 in NSCLC, hopefully it could help looking for
targeted drug treatment of Ang-2 in the future. .

Prediction of lung cancer metastasis relies on post-resection assessment of tumor
histology, which is a severe limitation since only a minority of lung cancer
patients are diagnosed with resectable disease. Therefore, characterization of
metastasis-predicting biomarkers in pre-resection small biopsy specimens is
urgently needed. Here we report a biomarker consisting of the phosphorylation of 
the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on serine 249 combined with elevated p39
expression. This biomarker correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
traits in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Immunohistochemistry
staining of NSCLC tumor microarrays showed that strong phospho-Rb S249 staining
positively correlated with tumor grade specifically in the squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) subtype. Strong immunoreactivity for p39 positively correlated
with tumor stage, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases, also in SCC.
Linear regression analyses showed that the combined scoring for phospho-Rb S249, 
p39 and E-cadherin in SCC is even more accurate at predicting tumor staging,
relative to each score individually. We propose that combined
immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC samples for Rb phosphorylation on S249,
p39, and E-cadherin protein expression could aid in the assessment of tumor
staging and metastatic potential when tested in small primary tumor biopsies. The
intense staining for phospho-Rb S249 that we observed in high grade SCC could
also aid in the precise sub-classification of poorly differentiated SCCs.

Aim: SSAT-1 is an enzyme that plays a critical role in cell growth. Amantadine, a
FDA-approved antiviral drug, is a substrate for SSAT-1. The utility of amantadine
as an agent to demonstrate elevated SSAT-1 activity linked to cancer was
conducted.
Results: High levels of SSAT-1 expression were measured in tumor human cell
lines, and in breast, prostate and lung tumor tissue. An increase in the urinary 
levels of acetylated amantadine in cancer patients was observed.
Conclusion: Increases in SSAT-1 contents in tumor tissue could be of value in
targeting cancers with high SSAT-1 expression for confirmation/quantification.
The high levels of acetylated amantadine could be used as a simple and useful
screening test for the presence of cancer.

BACKGROUND: It has been reported that the tumor microenvironment, including
tumor-associated immune cells (ICs) and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression, differs between primary and metastatic tumors. This study aimed to
elucidate the differences in PD-L1 expression on tumor cells (TCs) and ICs
between lung metastases and corresponding primary tumors.
METHODS: We analyzed paired lesions from 44 patients diagnosed with lung
metastases between 2005 and 2017 at Kyushu University. The percentages of
PD-L1-positive TCs and ICs in lung metastases and the primary tumor were
classified into five categories (0: <1%; 1: 1%-4%; 2: 5%-9%; 3: 10%-49%; and 4:
≥50%). Lesions in which ≥1% of the TCs and ICs were PD-L1-positive were
considered positive.
RESULTS: The primary cancers included rectal (n = 19), colon (n = 10), liver
(n = 10), bile duct (n = 2), stomach (n = 1), gall bladder (n = 1) and breast
(n = 1). Discrepancies in PD-L1 expression on TCs and ICs between lung metastases
and primary lesions were observed in 5 (11.4%, κ = 0.23) and 9 (20.5%, κ = 0.11) 
of the 44 cases, respectively. PD-L1 expression on ICs was higher in lung
metastases than paired primary tumors (p = 0.026), although the percentage of
PD-L1-positive TCs was not significantly different between lung metastases and
primary tumors (p = 0.767).
CONCLUSIONS: There were significant differences in PD-L1 expression on TCs and
ICs between lung metastases and primary tumors. Clinicians should be aware of
these differences in the tumor microenvironment when treating patients with
immunotherapy.

Several cancers, especially non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), are able to
escape the immunosurveillance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs); among the
molecules involved, the indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO-1) and the programmed 
cell death ligand-1 (PD-L1) play a crucial role. These aspects are of great
interest in the current immunotherapeutic era, therefore the current study
analyses the TILs, IDO-1, and PD-L1 interactions and their correlations with
clinicopathological parameters and prognosis in NSCLC. One hundred ninety-three
NSCLC surgical specimens, formalin-fixed, and paraffin-embedded were assessed for
TILs density, TILs localization, IDO-1 (clone 4.16H1), and PD-L1 (clone E1L3N)
immunohistochemical expressions. This data was correlated with
clinicopathological parameters, disease free, and overall survivals. IDO-1 and
PD-L1 high expressions were related to the solid pattern of adenocarcinomas
(respectively p = 0.036 and p = 0.026); high PD-L1 expression was correlated with
squamous histotype (p = 0.048). IDO-1 overexpression correlated with former
smokers (p = 0.041), higher adenocarcinoma stages (p = 0.039), and with both
higher TILs density and PD-L1 expression (respectively p = 0.025 and p = 0.0003).
A better prognosis was associated with TILs intratumoral or mixed localizations
(p = 0.029). TILs localization affects NSCLC prognosis; the higher expression of 
IDO-1 and PD-L1 in poorly differentiated and more aggressive lung
adenocarcinomas, as well as the correlation between high PD-L1 expression and
squamous cell histotype, confirm the more efficient immunoescaping of these NSCLC
subgroups.

BACKGROUND/AIM: Tumor Necrosis Factor-Related Apoptosis Inducing Ligand
(TRAIL)-based therapies have been used in many human cancers. However, some
tumors are resistant to TRAIL-induced cell death. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1
(ALDH1) is a functional marker for identification of CSCs.
METHODS: In this study, we used the colony formation assay, AnnexinV/ PI double
staining and PI staining to detect proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle in
ALDH1+ non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cells with TRAIL treatment. In
addition, we established xenograft mouse models to confirm the anti-tumor roles
of TRAIL in vivo. Finally, gene array and western blot were used to detect the
deeper mechanism of the susceptibility of ALDH1+ NSCLC cells to TRAIL.
RESULTS: We confirmed that TRAIL could inhibit proliferation, and induce
apoptosis and G1 arrest in ALDH1+ NSCLC cells. Correspondingly, TRAIL was
associated with decreased tumor size and the favorable survival rate of ALDH1+
cells established xenograft mouse models. ALDH1 could increase the death
receptors (DR) 4 and DR5 expression in ALDH1+ NSCLC cells via activating MEK/ERK 
signaling pathway.
CONCLUSION: ALDH1 protein induced MEK-1 mRNA stability and promoted its
translation via its 3'UTR.

Cisplatin (CDDP) is widely used as an anti-cancer platinum agent but its
therapeutic efficacy is limited by acquired drug resistance. To develop a new
therapeutic strategy that could overcome this resistance, it is important to
characterize CDDP-resistant cancer cells. Here we established human lung cancer
A549 cell-derived low- and high-grade CDDP-resistant sublines, termed ACR4 and
ACR20 cells, by stepwise increasing CDDP concentrations up to 4 and 20 μM,
respectively. ACR4 and ACR20 cells showed 6- and 16-fold higher resistance to
CDDP than A549 cells, respectively. Cell migration, invasion, and sphere
formation were significantly decreased, whereas expression of the stem cell
marker CD44v was increased in order of A549, ACR4, and ACR20 cells. The
expression of the cystine-glutamate transporter xCT, which is encoded by SLC7A11,
was upregulated because of the increased cell surface expression of CD44v in
ACR20 cells. Treatment with the xCT inhibitor salazosulfapyridine and knockdown
of SLC7A11 mRNA by a specific siRNA significantly improved sensitivity to CDDP in
A549, ACR4, and ACR20 cells. Thus, our results suggest that CD44v overexpression 
is not involved in cancer stem cell properties but increases xCT expression,
which leads to the acquisition of CDDP-resistance. This mechanism may contribute 
to the development of a new therapeutic strategy that can overcome resistance.

The SWI/SNF complex is a multimeric chromatin remodeling complex that has vital
roles in regulating gene expression and cancer development. However, to date few 
studies have deeply explored the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation. We applied
multi-omics analysis to explore the mechanism of SMARCA2 inactivation in The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and performed the dCas9-DNMT3a system to
evaluate the role of promoter methylation in SMARCA2 transcriptional regulation. 
We also assessed the tumor suppressing roles of SMARCA2 in lung cancer
development by in vitro experiments. SMARCA2 promoter hypermethylation was
significantly associated with decreased expression of SMARCA2. This result was
further confirmed in the results of our own tissues. In addition, we observed
that the mRNA level decreased by about 3 folds while the CpG island of promoter
is nearly 30% hypermethylated by dCas9-DNMT3a system in H1299 cells. We
identified SMARCA2 as a tumor suppressor gene whose expression was downregulated 
in lung cancers. Its inactivation was significantly associated with the poor
survival of lung cancer patients [hazard ratio, HR = 0.35 (0.27-0.45)]. Besides, 
we found that SMARCA2 was a tumor suppressor and can significantly inhibit lung

inactivation of SMARCA2. We also verified its oncogenetic roles of BRM
inactivation in lung adenocarcinoma, which may provide a potential target for the
clinical treatment.

BACKGROUND Although several complicated models have been built to evaluate the
prognosis of NSCLC patients receiving chemotherapy, simple economic models are
still needed to give a preliminary survival assessment of these patients.
MATERIAL AND METHODS This study retrospectively assessed the clinical and
biological parameters of 223 patients with advanced NSCLC. Univariate and
multivariate analyses of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival
(PFS) for the parameters and the prognostic score were assessed. RESULTS
Performance status (PS) score=1, smoking history, fibrinogenemia, thrombocytosis,
increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level, and anemia were independent
predictors of poor prognosis in the univariate analysis of OS and were assessed
in multivariate analysis. There was a significant difference in PS=1 (HR=2.134,
p<0.0001), increased LDH level (HR=1.508, p=0.014), thrombocytosis (HR=1.547,
p=0.012), and smoking history (HR=1.491, p=0.008), based on which the patients
were classified into 3 risk groups: low risk (0-1 points), moderate risk (2
points), and high risk (3-5 points). At p values of <0.0001, the median OS was
565, 340, and 273 days and the median progression-free survival was 250, 209, and
135 days, respectively in these 3 risk groups. CONCLUSIONS We established a new
prognostic score model using PS, LDH level, PLT count, and smoking history to
predict the survival of patients receiving first-line chemotherapy for advanced
NSCLC, which might be useful in clinical practice.

INTRODUCTION: Recent studies on check-point inhibitor therapy, which seems to
improve the prognosis of patients with advanced non-small cell lung carcinoma
increase the importance of immunohistochemical analyses of the programmed-death
receptor and of its ligand, PD-L1 protein.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: In our study we present results of PD-L1
immunohistochemical tumor cell expression in a series of 325 lung carcinoma
patients biopsies, using the clone 22C3 (and DAKO Link 48 immunostainer).
Evaluation of the expression using tissue proportion scoring system allowed to
distinguish negative cases (either 0 % or < 1 % of positive tumor cells) versus
positive cases in the categories 1-9 %, 10-49 % and ≥ 50 % of positive tumor
cells.
RESULTS: In association to histopathologic parameters we observed similar rates
of positive expression in patients with adenocarcinoma types (47,8 % of all the
cases) as well as with squamous cell carcinomas (44,4 %). Within these
histological categories, the rates of positivity were similar also in patients
with small versus large (resectional) biopsies. In the biopsies of patients with 
adenocarcinoma we identified differences in the PD-L1 protein expression
associated with its histological subtype. In the cases with predominant lepidic
pattern the PD-L1 positivity was present in 18,8 %, with predominant acinar or
papillary pattern in 40,8 % and in cases with predominant solid or micropapillary
component in 74,1 % of the cases resp. Keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas were
positive in 38,5 % and non-keratinizing in 53,8 % of all the cases. The hiqhest
incidence of an extensive posivity was observed in sarcomatoid carcinoma type.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: Immunohistochemically verified PD-L1 protein
expression represents a broadly accepted predictive biomarker for immunotherapy
of NSCLC patients. The indicated differences of the expression among various
NSCLC types and subtypes require to be verified in larger cohorts of patients in 
relation with clinical parameters to demonstrate whether it could be plausible to
use the PD-L1 expression in a role of a negative prognostic parameter.

Lung cancer still represents one of the most common and fatal neoplasm,
accounting for nearly 30% of all cancer-related deaths. Targeted therapies based 
on molecular tumor features and programmed death-1 (PD-1)/programmed death
ligand-1 (PDL-1) blockade immunotherapy have offered new therapeutic options for 
patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Activation of the
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-pathway promotes tumor growth and
progression, including angiogenesis, invasion, metastasis and inhibition of
apoptosis, providing a strong rationale for targeting this pathway. EGFR
expression is detected in up to 85% of NSCLC and has been demonstrated to be
associated with poor prognosis. Two approaches for blocking EGFR signaling are
available: prevention of ligand binding to the extracellular domain with
monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and inhibition of the intracellular tyrosine kinase 
activity with small molecules. There is a strong rationale to consider the
tumor's level of EGFR expression as one of the most significant predictive
biomarkers in this setting. In this paper we provide an update focusing on the
current status of EGFR-directed mAbs use for the treatment of patients with
advanced NSCLC, through a review of all clinical trials involving anti-EGFR mAbs 
in combination with chemotherapy (CT) for advanced disease and with
chemo-radiotherapy for stage III disease. Here we also discuss the current status
of predictive biomarkers for anti-EGFR mAbs when added to first-line CT in
patients with advanced NSCLC. Finally, we focused on the relevance of EGFR
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)+ and immunohistochemistry
(IHC)-Score ≥ 200 as predictive biomarkers for the selection of patients who
would be most likely to derive a clinical benefit from treatment with CT in
combination with anti-EGFR mAbs, with particular reference also to histology.

PURPOSE: We characterized the early changes in cardiovascular biomarkers with
contemporary thoracic radiation therapy (RT) and evaluated their associations
with radiation dose-volume metrics including mean heart dose (MHD), V5, and V30.
METHODS AND MATERIALS: In a prospective longitudinal study of 87 patients with
breast cancer, lung cancer, or mediastinal lymphoma treated with photon or proton
thoracic RT, blood samples were obtained pre-RT and after completion of RT
(median, 20 days; interquartile range [IQR], 1-35). High-sensitivity cardiac
troponin T, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, placental growth factor
(PIGF), and growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF-15) were measured. Associations
between MHD, V5 and V30, and biomarker levels and associations between
echocardiography-derived measures of cardiac function and biomarker levels were
assessed in multivariable linear regression models. Analyses were performed
according to the following subgroups: (1) breast cancer alone and (2) lung cancer
and lymphoma combined.
RESULTS: The median (IQR) estimates of MHD ranged from 1.3 Gy (0.9-2.4) in breast
cancer (n = 60) to 6.8 Gy (5.4-10.2) in mediastinal lymphoma (n = 14) and 8.4 Gy 
(6.7-16.1) in lung cancer (n = 13) patients (P < .001). There were no significant
increases in biomarker levels from pre-RT to post-RT in breast cancer. In lung
cancer/lymphoma, PIGF increased from a median (IQR) of 20 ng/L (16-26) to 22 ng/L
(16-30) (P = .005), and GDF-15 increased from 1171 ng/L (755-2493) to 1887 ng/L
(903-3763) (P = .006). MHD, V5, and V30 were significantly associated with
post-RT PIGF and GDF-15 levels in multivariable models. Changes in biomarkers
were not significantly associated with changes in echocardiography-derived
measures of cardiac function.
CONCLUSION: Contemporary thoracic RT induces acute abnormalities in vascular and 
inflammatory biomarkers that are associated with radiation dose-volume metrics,
particularly in lung cancer and mediastinal lymphoma. Long-term follow-up studies
are needed to determine the impact of these changes on the development of overt
cardiac disease.

The KRAB-ZNF (Krüppel-associated box domain zinc finger) gene family is composed 
of a large number of highly homologous genes, gene isoforms, and pseudogenes. The
proteins encoded by these genes, whose expression is often tissue-specific, act
as epigenetic suppressors contributing to the addition of repressive chromatin
marks and DNA methylation. Due to its high complexity, the KRAB-ZNF family has
not been studied in sufficient detail, and the involvement of its members in
carcinogenesis remains mostly unexplored. In this study, we aimed to provide a
comprehensive description of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs using publicly available
The Cancer Genome Atlas pan-cancer datasets. We analyzed 6727 tumor and normal
tissue samples from 16 cancer types. Here, we showed that a small but distinctive
cluster of 16 KRAB-ZNFs is commonly upregulated across multiple cancer cohorts in
comparison to normal samples. We confirmed these observations in the independent 
panels of lung and breast cancer cell lines and tissues. This upregulation was
also observed for most of the KRAB-ZNF splicing variants, whose expression is
simultaneously upregulated in tumors compared to normal tissues. Finally, by
analyzing the clinicopathological data for breast and lung cancers, we
demonstrated that the expression of cancer-associated KRAB-ZNFs correlates with
patient survival, tumor histology, and molecular subtyping. Altogether, our study
allowed the identification and characterization of KRAB-ZNF factors that may have
an essential function in cancer biology and thus potential to become novel
oncologic biomarkers and treatment targets.

MicroRNAs, a class of short endogenous RNAs, acting as post-transcriptional
regulators of gene expression, mostly silence gene expression via binding
imperfectly matched sequences in the 3'UTR of target mRNA. MiR-17-92, a highly
conserved gene cluster, has 6 members including miR-17, miR-18a, miR-19a,
miR-20a, miR-19b-1 and miR-92a. The miR-17-92 cluster, regarded as oncogene, is
overexpressed in human cancers. Lung cancer is the leading cause of death all
over the world. The molecular mechanism of lung cancer has been partly known at
the levels of genes and proteins in last decade. However, new prognosis
biomarkers and more target drugs should be developed in future. Therefore,
noncoding RNAs, especially miRNAs, make them as new potentially clinical
biomarkers for diagnosis and prognosis. In this review, we focus the current
progress of miR-17-92 cluster in lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus has been repeatedly associated with
exposure to smoking from the foetal period onwards. We explored whether DNA
methylation may be a mechanism that links exposure to maternal prenatal smoking
with offspring's adult cardio-metabolic health.
METHODS: We meta-analysed the association between DNA methylation at GFI1-locus
with maternal prenatal smoking, adult own smoking, and cardio-metabolic
phenotypes in 22 population-based studies from Europe, Australia, and USA
(n = 18,212). DNA methylation at the GFI1-locus was measured in whole-blood.
Multivariable regression models were fitted to examine its association with
exposure to prenatal and own adult smoking. DNA methylation levels were analysed 
in relation to body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), fasting glucose
(FG), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), triglycerides (TG),
diastolic, and systolic blood pressure (BP).
FINDINGS: Lower DNA methylation at three out of eight GFI1-CpGs was associated
with exposure to maternal prenatal smoking, whereas, all eight CpGs were
associated with adult own smoking. Lower DNA methylation at cg14179389, the
strongest maternal prenatal smoking locus, was associated with increased WC and
BP when adjusted for sex, age, and adult smoking with Bonferroni-corrected
P < 0·012. In contrast, lower DNA methylation at cg09935388, the strongest adult 
own smoking locus, was associated with decreased BMI, WC, and BP (adjusted
1 × 10-7 < P < 0.01). Similarly, lower DNA methylation at cg12876356, cg18316974,
cg09662411, and cg18146737 was associated with decreased BMI and WC
(5 × 10-8 < P < 0.001). Lower DNA methylation at all the CpGs was consistently
associated with higher TG levels.
INTERPRETATION: Epigenetic changes at the GFI1 were linked to smoking exposure
in-utero/in-adulthood and robustly associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors.

Owing to the poor prognosis, novel biomarkers for lung adenocarcinoma (LACA) are 
needed nowadays. The aim of the study was to identify the differential miRNAs
expression between lung cancer and normal tissues and evaluate the prognostic
values of the miRNAs. Multidimensional data of 528 samples were retrieved from
The Cancer Genome Atlas archive. Data analysis was based on a computational
approach to detect survival-associated molecular signatures. A total of 191
differentially expressed miRNAs were identified between LACA tissues and normal
tissues, including 88 up-regulated and 103 down-regulated miRNAs. The
Kaplan-Meier survival method revealed the prognostic function of the three miRNAs
(miR-1293, miR-873 and miR-1914). Cox regression analysis showed that the
three-miRNA signature was an independent prognostic factor in LACA. The
functional enrichment analysis suggested that the target genes of three miRNAs
may be involved in various pathways related to the cancer. This study
demonstrated that the three-miRNA signature (miR-1293, miR-873 and miR-1914)
could be used as a prognostic marker in LACA.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths
worldwide. The outcome of patients with non-small cell lung cancer remains poor; 
the 5-year survival rate for stage IV non-small cell lung cancer is only 1.0%.
KIF15 is a tetrameric kinesin spindle motor that has been investigated for its
regulation of mitosis. While the roles of kinesin motor proteins in the
regulation of mitosis and their potentials as therapeutic targets in pancreatic
cancer have been described previously, the role of KIF15 in lung cancer
development remains unknown.
METHODS: Paired lung carcinoma specimens and matched adjacent normal tissues were
used for protein analysis. Clinical data were obtained from medical records. We
first examined KIF15 messenger RNA expression in The Cancer Genome Atlas
database, and then determined KIF15 protein levels using immunohistochemistry and
western blotting. Differences between the groups were analyzed using repeated
measures analysis of variance. Overall survival was analyzed using the
Kaplan-Meier method. Cell-cycle and proliferation assays were conducted using
A549, NCI-H1299, and NCI-H226 cells.
RESULTS: KIF15 was significantly upregulated at both the messenger RNA and
protein levels in human lung tumor tissues. In patients with lung adenocarcinoma,
KIF15 expression was positively associated with disease stages; high KIF15
expression predicted a poor prognosis. KIF15 knockdown using short hairpin RNA in
two human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines induced G1/S phase cell cycle arrest and
inhibited cell growth, but there was no effect in human lung squamous cell
carcinoma.
CONCLUSION: Our findings show that KIF15 is involved in lung cancer
carcinogenesis. KIF15 could therefore serve as a specific prognostic marker for
patients with lung adenocarcinoma.

Lung cancer as the major cause of cancer mortality worldwide includes several
histologic subtypes evolving from numerous genetic and epigenetic changes
emerging in alveolar, bronchiolar and bronchial epithelium. The majority of cases
are diagnosed in advanced stage (i.e. stages IIIB and IV), often with scanty
amount of tissue in transbronchial biopsies or cytology specimens. The aim of the
present study was to investigate the expression of the scaffolding protein neural
precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) in small
biopsies of lung adenocarcinoma. The expression of NEDD9 was analyzed
immunohistochemically in 71 formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded transbronchial
biopsy specimens of primary lung adenocarcinoma. Nuclear and cytoplasmic NEDD9
expression was detected indicating activation of the epithelial-mesenchymal
transition process. Direct relationship between the expression of NEDD9 and
survival was not demonstrated.

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is the most frequently encountered
progressive lung disease in clinical practice. This study sought to determine the
predictive ability of the tumor biomarker cancer antigen-125 (CA-125) in the
identification of COPD in a cohort of 284 patients with COPD living at high
altitude (with an average elevation of over 2500 m).Patients were classified by
pleural effusion volumes into 4 categories and serum CA-125 concentrations were
measured in each category. The analyses revealed that CA-125 concentrations were 
positively and significantly correlated with pleural effusion volume. CA-125
concentrations were also positively correlated with pulmonary heart disease and
acute exacerbations of COPD, and negatively correlated with pulmonary
hypertension.The study evidence suggests that serum CA-125 concentrations are
positively correlated with the risk of pleural effusions among patients with COPD
living in high-altitude areas, and that CA-125 concentrations are also correlated
with pulmonary heart disease, acute exacerbations, and pulmonary hypertension.

Mitochondrial (mt) DNA has been long suggested to contribute to carcinogenesis,
and a variety of mutations in mtDNA have been confirmed to be related to various 
early stages of cancers; these data revealed that the detection of mtDNA in
clinical samples may be a promising approach for cancer diagnosis. In the present
study, the serum mtDNA in healthy donors and groups of patients with cancer was
detected. It was revealed that patients with lung cancer without metastasis had
more mtDNA in serum compared to patients with metastasis. Moreover,
TLR9‑associated signalling was activated in vitro after treatment with a
synthetic CpG oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN) called ODN‑M362. In addition, our
data revealed that TLR9 and its adaptor protein, MyD88, were induced by ODN‑M362 
in a dose‑dependent manner. A human cytokine array to evaluate stimulation of
cytokine secretion by ODN‑M362 was also used. Our findings may identify the role 
that TLR9 and mtDNA play in lung cancer progression and metastasis.

Lysophospholipase1 (LYPLA1) also known as acyl‑protein thioesterase1 (APT1)
belongs to the superfamily of α/β hydrolase. It has been found to have the
properties of a homodimer by manifesting depalmitoylation as well as
lysophospholipase activity. LYPLAs are under the control of both microRNAs,
miR‑138 and miR‑424. They were observed to be significantly overexpressed in
chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells. To date, LYPLAs are the sole enzymes
recognized to activate depalmitoylation. In this study, we provide the expression
pattern of LYPLA1 in non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) using four different
NSCLC cell lines. Western blot analysis and RT‑PCR were performed to detect the
protein expression and mRNA expression of LYPLA1 in NSCLC cell lines. We detected
the highest LYPLA1 protein expression level in SPC‑A‑1 cells followed by A549
cells, and the highest LYPLA1 mRNA expression level was detected in the SPC‑A‑1
cells followed by the H1299 cell line. We found that suppression of LYPLA1
expression using small‑interfering RNA significantly inhibited proliferation,
migration and invasion of the LYPLA1‑transfected NSCLC cells. Furthermore, we
explored the involvement of LYPLA1 in the regulation of epithelial‑mesenchymal
transition (EMT). The epithelial marker E‑cadherin was significantly increased,
while mesenchymal markers N‑cadherin, vimentin and SNAIL were markedly decreased 
in the LYPLA1‑silenced cells. Collectively the results of the present study
suggest that the LYPLA1 gene plays a tumor‑promotor role in NSCLC cells in vitro.

OBJECTIVE: Human U three protein 14a (hUTP14a) facilitates tumorigenesis through 
promoting p53 and Rb degradation as well as enhancing c-Myc oncogenic activity.
Moreover, hUTP14a expression is up-regulated in human hepatocellular cancer and
colorectal cancer tissues. In this study, the expression of hUTP14a in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining
(IHC). The relationship between hUTP14a expression levels and the clinical
characteristics of the NSCLC patients were analyzed.
METHODS: Lung cancer tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues were
collected from 123 cases of NSCLC patients including 53 cases of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and 70 cases of adenocarcinoma (ADC), who had accepted surgical
resection at Peking University Third Hospital from May 2003 to April 2006. The
expression level of hUTP14a was determined by IHC in human NSCLC tissues and the 
adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The associations between hUTP14a expression and
the clinical pathological variables including gender, age, tumor size,
histological type, differentiation degree and clinical pathological stage were
analyzed using the Pearson's χ2 test.
RESULTS: The expression rate of hUTP14a in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher
than that in the non-cancerous tissues (37.4% vs. 0, P<0.001). The expressions of
hUTP14a in lung ADC and SCC were 48.6% and 20.6%, respectively. The expression
rate of hUTP14a in both lung ADC and SCC was significantly higher than that in
the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P<0.001). In addition, the expression rate of
hUTP14a in lung ADC was significantly higher than that in SCC (χ2=8.66, P=0.003).
Furthermore, the expression rate of hUTP14a in the late pTNM stage of SCC was
significantly higher than that in the early pTNM stage of SCC while hUTP14a
expression level was not associated with pTNM stage of ADC. No correlation was
found between hUTP14a expression and the other clinical pathologic features of
the patients.
CONCLUSION: Expression of hUTP14a was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and was
correlated with pTNM stage of SCC, suggesting that hUTP14a might possess a
potential as a candidate marker for the early diagnosis screening of NSCLC.

PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the expression of ZWINT, NUSAP1, DLGAP5, and PRC1 in
tumor tissues and adjacent tissues with public data.
METHODS: The expression patterns of four genes were detected in cancer tissues
and adjacent tissues by qRT-PCR. The overall survival analysis was used to
explore these genes in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients. 
Knockdown assays were used to select the most suitable gene among these four
genes. Cell function assays with the knockdown gene were conducted in A549 and
NCL H226 cells. The role of the knockdown gene in lung cancer was dissected in a 
mice tumor model. Transcriptome sequencing analyses with the knockdown gene were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Overexpression of these genes was significantly detected in cancer
tissues (P < 0.01). Overall survival revealed that high expression of these genes
is closely related with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients
(P < 0.05). Knockdown of ZWINT reduced proliferation in NCI H226 and A549 cells
(P < 0.05). Knockdown also inhibited cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, and
colony formation (P < 0.05). ZWINT knockdown reduced tumor volume (P < 0.05).
Transcriptome sequencing of ZWINT knockdown-treated A549 and NCI H226 cells
indicated that 100 and 426 differentially expressed genes were obtained,
respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested that binding, biological
regulation, and multicellular organismal processes were the most enriched. KEGG
analysis revealed that TNF, P53, and PI3K signal networks would be the most
potential ZWINT-related pathways and were identified by Western blot analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: ZWINT may be a novel target for lung cancer therapy.

Background: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. Despite
advances in lung cancer therapies, prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer is
still unfavorable. The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic value of 
key genes in lung tumorigenesis.
Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out by GEO2R from
three Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. Common DEGs were selected for Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment
analysis. Protein- protein interaction networks were constructed by the STRING
database and visualized by Cytoscape software. Hub genes, filtered from the
CytoHubba, were validated using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive
Analysis database, and their genomic alterations were identified by performing
the cBioportal. Finally, overall survival analysis of hub genes was performed
using Kaplan-Meier Plotter.
Results: From three datasets, 169 DEGs (70 upregulated and 99 downregulated) were
identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
analyses showed that upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in cell cycle, 
p53 pathway, and extracellular matrix-receptor interactions; the downregulated
DEGs were significantly enriched in PPAR pathway and tyrosine metabolism. The
protein-protein interaction network consisted of 71 nodes and 305 edges,
including 49 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes. The hub genes, including
AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, were overexpressed compared with the
normal group by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis analysis, and
associated with reduced overall survival in lung cancer patients. In the genomic 
alterations analysis, two hotspot mutations (S2021C/F and E314K/V) were
identified in Pfam protein domains.
Conclusion: DEGs, including AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, might be
potential biomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.

Lung cancer, of which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~85% of
cases, remains a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality and morbidity
worldwide. Tumor suppressor p53 is a master regulator of diverse cellular
processes and is a therapeutic target in cancer. However, many aspects of its
transcriptional regulation are still not well defined. WD repeat containing
antisense to TP53α (Wrap53α) a newly identified natural antisense transcript of
p53, can regulate p53 expression following DNA damage. The present study
determined the methylation status of the Wrap53α promoter in primary lung tissues
using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and evaluated its
associations with clinicopathological features and survival in patients with
NSCLC. The Wrap53α promoter was methylated in 12 (8.2%) of 146 malignant tissues.
Its methylation was associated with the downregulation of its transcription and
was frequently detected in patients with stages II-IIIA (P=0.03), and p53
mutation-negative cases (P=0.08). Methylation of Wrap53α promoter was associated 
with worse overall survival of total patients with a borderline significance
[adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR)=2.44, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.98-6.04,
P=0.05]. Notably, Wrap53α promoter methylation significantly associated with poor
overall survival in p53 mutation-negative patients (log-rank P=0.01, adjusted
HR=2.92, 95% CI=1.00-8.60, P=0.05), but not in patients with p53 mutations. The
results of the present study suggest that Wrap53α may serve a role in the
pathogenesis of a subset of lung cancer, and its methylation may be considered to
be a prognostic marker for surgically resected NSCLC patients. However, further
studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm this finding.

Cyclic long noncoding RNAs have recently become major players in cancer biology
and can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and as potential 
therapeutic targets. We explored circulating LINC00342 as a predictor of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of LINC00342 in tissues,
serum, PBMC, and NSCLC cell lines were screened by reverse transcription
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A multistage validation and risk score
formula detection analysis was used. The effect of LINC00342 on proliferation was
assessed by MTT, p53, and PTEN pathways, which were analyzed by Western blot
analysis. We found that LINC00342 was upregulated in the tissues, serum, and PBMC
of patients with NSCLC. In addition, patients with higher LINC00342 expression
levels were associated with poor overall survival. For the diagnosis of NSCLC,
the specificity and sensitivity of LINC00342 were significantly higher than that 
of CYFRA 21-1. Moreover, LINC00342 promoted proliferation by inhibiting the
expression of p53 and PTEN proteins in NSCLC cell lines. Our study demonstrates
that LINC00342 is involved in the development, and LINC00342 may be a potential
diagnostic factor and a target for new therapies for future patients with NSCLC.

Clinical significance of interleukin-6 in diagnosis of lung, oral, esophageal,
and gall bladder carcinomas.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Lab Medicine, Delhi State Cancer Institute, New Delhi, India.

Introduction: Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer. Cytokines play an
essential role in cancer pathogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic
cytokine that enables growth and differentiation of tumors. The effects of IL-6
are mediated by signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3).
STAT3 deficiency reduced tumor incidence and growth while STAT3 hyperactivation
has an opposite effect; also it negatively regulates p53 gene. IL-6/STAT3
signaling is crucial in carcinogenesis linked to inflammation. Increased IL-6
levels are observed in cancer. Studies investigating the role of IL-6 is limited.
Aim: This study aims at determining IL-6 levels in lung, oral, esophageal, and
gallbladder cancer patients.
Materials and Methods: Subjects consisted of 175 patients with lung, oral, gall
bladder, and esophageal cancers. The patients included 68 females and 107 males
with an average age of 52 years. Fifty healthy individuals served as controls.
IL-6 was detected by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay principle.
Results: IL-6 values were determined in 175 (21 lung, 55 oral, 17 esophageal and 
82 gallbladder) cancer patients. Of these, 147/175 (18 lung, 43 oral, 13
esophageal and 73 gallbladder) cancer patients (84%) showed higher IL-6 levels as
compared to control group (normal range: <7 pg/ml).
Conclusion: This indicates a significant correlation between IL-6 overexpression 
and cancer development, highlighting the significance of IL-6 in oral, lung,
esophageal, and gallbladder carcinomas. IL-6 may be used as a tumor marker for
cancer diagnosis. It may be a clinically significant predictor and may represent 
a target for cancer treatment. However, to definitely conclude this, further
extensive studies would be required.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis worldwide and the number 
one cause of cancer deaths. Exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor 
in lung cancer, reduces epithelial barrier integrity and increases susceptibility
to infections. Herein, we hypothesize that somatic mutations together with
cigarette smoke generate a dysbiotic microbiota that is associated with lung
carcinogenesis. Using lung tissue from 33 controls and 143 cancer cases, we
conduct 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial gene sequencing, with RNA-sequencing
data from lung cancer cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas serving as the validation 
cohort.
RESULTS: Overall, we demonstrate a lower alpha diversity in normal lung as
compared to non-tumor adjacent or tumor tissue. In squamous cell carcinoma
specifically, a separate group of taxa are identified, in which Acidovorax is
enriched in smokers. Acidovorax temporans is identified within tumor sections by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization and confirmed by two separate 16S rRNA
strategies. Further, these taxa, including Acidovorax, exhibit higher abundance
among the subset of squamous cell carcinoma cases with TP53 mutations, an
association not seen in adenocarcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this comprehensive study show both microbiome-gene
and microbiome-exposure interactions in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer
tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can impair
epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortium that is higher in
relative abundance in smoking-associated tumors of this type. Given the
significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may
provide novel biomarkers for early detection.

The tumour‑suppressor protein p53 is a key regulator of multiple cellular
processes and exerts its tumour‑suppressor function by inducing apoptotic cell
death. However, emerging evidence indicates that p53 is also involved in inducing
ferroptosis, which is a unique iron‑dependent form of non‑apoptotic cell death
triggered by the RAS‑selective lethal small molecule erastin. Previous studies
have shown that erastin exposure induces increased ROS accumulation and oxidative
stress. In the present study, we incubated A549 cells with erastin and detected
ROS accumulation. Semi‑quantitative western blotting was performed to analyse the
effect of the induced ROS on p53 activity. To determine how ROS activate p53,
NAC, an ROS scavenger, and KU‑55933, an ATM kinase inhibitor, were employed to
co‑incubate with erastin, followed by western blot analysis. Either p53 or
SLC7A11 siRNA was introduced into A549 cells to silence the target‑gene
expression, followed by ROS detection to illustrate the regulatory role of
ROS‑activated p53 on its target gene SLC7A11. Annexin V‑FITC/PI staining was
performed to detect the induction of apoptotic cell death by erastin exposure. To
further assess the effects of erastin treatment on cellular proliferation, EdU
staining and cell cycle flow cytometric analysis were performed. Erastin exposure
upregulated and activated p53 and thus, transcriptionally activated its
downstream target genes, including p21 and Bax, in lung cancer A549 cells
dependent on erastin‑induced ROS. Subsequently, activated p53 by erastin
treatment suppressed SLC7A11 and induced ROS accumulation, indicating the
potential feedback loop between p53 and erastin‑induced ROS. By employing the
caspase inhibitor Z‑VAD‑FMK, it was revealed that erastin‑induced p53 contributed
to both ferroptotic and apoptotic cell death and inhibited cell proliferation via
arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase. Collectively, these results indicated that 
p53 may contribute to the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects associated with
establishing a feedback loop with ROS induced by erastin.

Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor that may
occur in many anatomic sites of the body.In this study, we compared the different
expression of neuroendocrine markers, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1),
p53, and Ki-67 in 23 cases of cervical SCC and 56 cases of pulmonary SCC using
immunohistochemistry.Our study showed that cervical SCC had a younger onset age
than pulmonary counterpart. Although both had the similar morphological features,
different immunohistochemical expression panel was observed in this study. As
neuroendocrine tumors, SCC of cervix and lung had similar immunoreactive staining
for CD56 and chromogranin A, but the expression of the synaptophysin in cervical 
SCC was significantly higher than that in pulmonary SCC (P = .007). The TTF-1
expression of pulmonary SCC illustrating diffuse and strong positivity in tumor
cell nuclei was significantly higher than that of the cervical SCC (P = .003).
There was only 1 case showing p53 protein over-expression in the 23 cases of
cervical SCC, and p53 over-expression was observed in 42.9% of pulmonary SCC
(P = .001). Only 9 cases of cervical SCC showed ≥80% of the Ki-67 proliferation
index, while it was found in 94.6% of pulmonary SCC (P < .001).The different
immunohistochemical expressions of these 2 kinds of SCCs may be related with
their pathogenetic mechanism, and these differences may be helpful in the
identification of the origins of the metastatic SCC with unknown primary site.

In recent years, the incidence of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become
the highest lethal rate of cancer worldwide. Molecular assays of EGFR, KRAS,
BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and Her‑2 are widely used to guide individualized treatment in
NSCLC patients. Somatic mutations in 112 NSCLC patients, including 7 oncogenic
driver genes, were detected by Iontorrent personal genome machine (PGM). Sanger
sequencing was used to test and verify the results of PGM. Apart from uncommon
mutations of EGFR, 101 NSCLC specimens were tested by droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR). According to NGS results, mutations were detected in EGFR (58/112,
51.79% of tumors), KRAS (10/112, 8.93%), BRAF (2/112, 1.79%), NRAS (2/112,
1.79%), Her‑2 (2/112, 1.79%), PIK3CA (6/112, 5.36%) and TP53 (31/112, 27.69%).
There were 27 samples without any somatic mutations in all genes while 24 samples
harboured mutations in two or more genes. A total of 61 samples had one or more
mutations in a single gene. All alterations of 7 genes were presented and the
overall detection rate of NGS and Sanger sequencing was determined to be 51.79%
(58/112) and 37.50% (42/112), respectively (χ2=5.88, P=0.015). Compared with
Sanger sequencing, the total sensitivity and specificity of NGS assays was 95.24%
(40/42) and 77.14% (54/70), respectively. The overall detection rate of NGS and
ddPCR was 45.54% (46/101) and 47.52% (48/101), respectively (χ2=0.000598,
P=0.98). Compared with ddPCR, the overall sensitivity and specificity of NGS
assays was 95.83% (46/48) and 98.11% (52/53), respectively. The findings
indicated that the positive mutation rate of EGFR tested by NGS was significantly
lower than that by Sanger sequencing, but the difference between ddPCR and NGS
was not statistically significant. The high degree of agreement of reportable
variants is proposed in both NGS and ddPCR analysis, suggesting the performance
of NGS assays in routine clinical detection may be useful in determining the
treatment decisions in NSCLC patients.

Ki-67 parameter is a proliferation marker in malignant tumors. The increased
proliferation activity and the decreased prognosis in lung cancer determined us
to investigate different parameters connected to the tumor's aggression, such as 
cellularity, Ki-67 positivity rate, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA). We evaluated the proliferative activity in 62 primary lung tumors by
determining the cell's percentage of Ki-67 and immunoreactive PCNA (using MIB-1
and PCNA monoclonal antibodies), classifying Ki-67 and PCNA immunoreactivity into
three score groups. The results obtained emphasized a linkage between Ki-67 score
with the histological tumor subtype, tumor cellularity and degree of
differentiation and with other proliferation immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers, 
such as p53 cellular tumor antigen. The tumor's cellularity, the Ki-67 positivity
rate and PCNA, together with the clinical stage and the histological
differentiation bring extra pieces of useful information in order to anticipate
the evolution and the prognosis of lung cancer.

Lung tumors represent a major health problem. In early stage NSCLC tumors,
surgical resection is the preferred treatment, but 30-55% of patients will
relapse within 5 years after surgery. Thus, the identification of prognostic
biomarkers in early stage NSCLC patients, especially those which are
therapeutically addressable, is crucial to enhance survival of these patients. We
determined the immunohistochemistry expression of key proteins involved in
tumorigenesis and oncogenic signaling, p53, EGFR, pAKT and pERK, and correlated
their expression level to clinicopathological characteristics and patient
outcome. We found EGFR expression is higher in the squamous cell carcinomas than 
in adenocarcinomas (p=0.043), and that nuclear p53 staining correlated with lower
differentiated squamous tumors (p=0.034). Regarding the prognostic potential of
the expression of these proteins, high pERK levels proved to be an independent
prognostic factor for overall (p<0.001) and progression-free survival (p<0.001)
in adenocarcinoma patients, but not in those from the squamous histology, and
high p53 nuclear levels were identified as independent prognostic factor for
progression-free survival (p=0.031) only in squamous cell carcinoma patients. We 
propose a role as early prognostic biomarkers for pERK protein levels in
adenocarcinoma, and for nuclear p53 levels in squamous cell lung carcinoma. The
determination of these potential biomarkers in the adequate histologic context
may predict the outcome of early stage NSCLC patients, and may offer a
therapeutic opportunity to enhance survival of these patients.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the subtype of lung cancer with the highest
degree of malignancy and the lowest degree of differentiation. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of SCLC using
bioinformatics analysis, and to provide new ideas for the early diagnosis and
targeted therapy of SCLC. Microarray data were downloaded from Gene Expression
Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SCLC were compared with the
normal lung samples and identified. Gene Ontology (GO) function and pathway
analysis of DEGs was performed through the DAVID database. Furthermore,
microarray data was analyzed by using the clustering analysis tool GoMiner.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed using the
STRING online database. Protein expression was determined from the Human Protein 
Atlas, and SCLC gene expression was determined using Oncomine. In total, 153 DEGs
were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the majority of DEGs
were associated with the cell cycle. CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1 and CDK1 were
identified to contribute to the progression of SCLC through combined use of GO,
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and a PPI network.
mRNA and protein expression were also validated in an integrative database. The
present study indicated that the formation of SCLC may be associated with cell
cycle regulation. In addition, the four crucial genes CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1 and
CDK1, which are downstream of p53, may have important roles in the occurrence and
progression of SCLC, and thus may be promising potential biomarkers and
therapeutic targets.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 and its dynamic patterns have caused widespread
attention in the field of cancer research. Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated
kinase 1 (SGK1) with features of serine/threonine kinase activity, which also
contributes to the structural and functional similarities with the AKT family of 
kinases, is a key enzyme in the regulation of immune responses in tumor cells,
and SGK1 was noted to be expressed in close relation to p53 protein levels, and
there exists a negative feedback pathway between intracellular SGK1 and p53.
Noteworthy, SGK1 was detected to play a role in the development of resistance to 
cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that high SGK1 expression had
strong prognostic value for reduced overall survival in NSCLC patients. Detection
of SGK1 collectively was helpful to predict the prognosis of NSCLC. We also
identified the expression level of SGK1 and the p53 pathway including downstream 
apoptotic proteins under the stimulation of γ-radiation and SGK1 inhibitor
GSK650394, which presented a series of dynamic fluctuations. Our results suggest 
that SGK1 dynamics could play an important role in cell signaling, which is
capable of directly influencing NSCLC cellular fate decisions.

BACKGROUND: This study aimmed to evaluate the expression of p53-inducible RR
small subunit 2 homologue (p53R2) in Lung sarcomatoid carcinoma (LSC) and its
association with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, clinicopathological factors and prognostic significance
of the expression of p53R2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 100 
cases of LSC.
RESULTS: The results showed that the expression of p53R2 was significantly
correlated with clinical stage (P<0.05). But there was no statistically
correlation with gender, age, smoking, tumor size, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage, 
therapy and relapse. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the expression of p53R2,
clinical stage, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage and tumor size were closely related 
to patients' survival, and the analysis also revealed that patients with low
expression of p53R2 had a longer overall survival than that with high expression 
(Mean overall survival: 84.8 months vs. 34.7 months, P<0.05). Further
multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of p53R2 was identified as an
independent prognostic factor in the prediction of the overall survival for
patients with LSC (HR = 3.217, P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of p53R2 was inversely associated with the
proliferation and progression of LSC, and the results indicated that the high
expression of p53R2 was an independent factor for unfavorable prognosis of
patients with LSC.

BACKGROUND: NKX2-1, a key molecule in lung development, is highly expressed in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (ADK),
where it is a diagnostic marker. Studies of the prognostic role of NKX2-1 in
NSCLC have reported contradictory findings. Two microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
associated with NKX2-1: miR-365, which targets NKX2-1; and miR-33a, which is
downstream of NKX2-1. We have examined the effect of NKX2-1, miR-365 and miR-33a 
on survival in a cohort of early-stage NSCLC patients and in sub-groups of
patients classified according to the mutational status of TP53, KRAS, and EGFR.
METHODS: mRNA and miRNA expression was determined using TaqMan assays in 110
early-stage NSCLC patients. TP53, KRAS, and EGFR mutations were assessed by
Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: NKX2-1 expression was upregulated in never-smokers (P = 0.017), ADK
(P < 0.0001) and patients with wild-type TP53 (P = 0.001). A negative correlation
between NKX2-1 and miR-365 expression was found (ρ = -0.287; P = 0.003) but there
was no correlation between NKX2-1 and miR-33a expression. Overall survival (OS)
was longer in patients with high expression of NKX2-1 than in those with low
expression (80.8 vs 61.2 months (P = 0.035), while a trend towards longer OS was 
observed in patients with low miR-365 levels (P = 0.07). The impact of NKX2-1 on 
OS and DFS was higher in patients with neither TP53 nor KRAS mutations. Higher
expression of NKX2-1 was related to higher OS (77.6 vs 54 months; P = 0.017) and 
DFS (74.6 vs 57.7 months; P = 0.006) compared to low expression. The association 
between NKX2-1 and OS and DFS was strengthened when the analysis was limited to
patients with stage I disease (P = 0.005 and P=0.003 respectively).

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic therapy is a promising popular treatment modality for
various cancers. Histone modification and miRNA should not be underestimated in
lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether chidamide, a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which inhibits telomerase activity and induces
cell cycle arrest, influences ROS and miRNA production in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells.
METHODS: H1355 and A549 were treated with chidamide. The analysis of DNA content 
was measured by FACSCalibur equipped with a 488 nm laser. H1355 cells were
transfected with miR-129-3p mimic by Lipofectamine2000. Telomerase activity was
performed on the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Detection 
of thymidylate synthase (TS), p21, p53, pRB, and β-actin, were performed by
western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Our data showed that expression of TS, p21, and pRB were altered in the 
presence of chidamide by PCR and western blot. Using BrdU-incorporation analysis,
we found that chidamide induced G1 arrest through the regulation of the TS gene
by miR-129-3p. Chidamide was shown to suppress telomerase activity in the TRAP
assay and reduced the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) by PCR and q-PCR in H1355 and A549 cells. Chidamide increased the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry. N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC), a ROS scavenger, attenuated chidamide-induced telomerase activity
inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Chidamide repressed telomerase activity through ROS accumulation and 
cell cycle arrest by miR-129-3p upregulation in both H1355 and A549 cells. This
is the first study to demonstrate that chidamide induces miR-129-3p upregulation 
and ROS accumulation, leading to cell cycle arrest.

Cellular senescence is characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest, triggered by
a variety of stresses, such as telomerase inhibition, and it is recognized as a
tumor-suppressor mechanism. In recent years, telomerase has become an important
therapeutic target in several cancers; inhibition of telomerase can induce
senescence via the DNA damage response (DDR). Pterostilbene (PT), a dimethyl
ether analog of resveratrol, possesses a variety of biological functions,
including anticancer effects; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 
effects are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possible
mechanisms of PT-induced senescence through telomerase inhibition in human
non-small cell lung cancer cells and delineated the role of p53 in senescence.
The results indicated that PT-induced senescence is characterized by a flattened 
morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated-β galactosidase activity,
and the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Telomerase
activity and protein expression was significantly decreased in H460 (p53 wild
type) cells compared with H1299 (p53 null) cells and p53 knockdown H460 cells
(H460-p53-). A more detailed mechanistic study revealed that PT-induced
senescence partially occurred via a p53-dependent mechanism, triggering
inhibition of telomerase activity and protein expression, and leading to the DDR,
S phase arrest and, finally, cellular senescence. This study is the first to
explore the novel anticancer mechanism of PT senescence induction via the
inhibition of telomerase in lung cancer cells.

WD repeat protein 79 (WDR79) is a member of the WD-repeat protein family
characterized by the presence of a series of WD-repeat domains and is a scaffold 
protein that participates in telomerase assembly, Cajal body formation and DNA
double strand break repair. Although previous studies have revealed that WDR79 is
frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and promotes the
proliferation of NSCLC cells, the underlying mechanism responsible for
WDR79-mediated NSCLC proliferation is not fully understood. In this study, we
report a novel molecular function of WDR79 that mediates NSCLC cell proliferation
by controlling the stability of UHRF1. In the nucleus, WDR79 colocalized and
interacted with UHRF1. As a result, overexpression of WDR79 stabilized UHRF1,
whereas ablation of WDR79 decreased the level of UHRF1. Meanwhile, we showed that
WDR79 can protect UHRF1 from poly-ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, which
facilitated the stabilization of UHRF1. We further demonstrated that WDR79 exerts
a proliferation effect on NSCLC cells by stabilizing UHRF1. These findings reveal
that WDR79 is a novel UHRF1 regulator by maintaining UHRF1 stability, and they
also provide a clue as to how to explore WDR79 for potential therapeutic
application in NSCLC.

Inactivation of the fragile histidine triad (Fhit) gene has been reported in the 
majority of human cancers, particularly in lung cancer. The role of Fhit as a
tumor suppressor gene has been well documented, and restoration of Fhit
expression suppresses tumorigenicity in tumor cell lines and in mouse models by
inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells. Autophagy is a
catabolic pathway, whereby cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are sequestered in
vacuoles and delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Although
autophagy is necessary for cell survival under stress conditions, recent studies 
have shown that autophagy can also promote cell death. Due to the fact that both 
autophagy induction and Fhit expression are commonly associated with nutrient
starvation, we hypothesized that Fhit expression may be related to autophagy
induction. In the present study, we assessed whether Fhit overexpression by gene 
transfer induces autophagy in Fhit-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells. The results of our study indicate that Fhit protein induces autophagy in
NSCLC cells, and that this autophagy prevents apoptotic cell death in vivo and in
vitro in a 14-3-3τ protein-dependent manner. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report to describe Fhit-induced autophagy. Suppressing autophagy
might be a promising therapeutic option to enhance the efficacy of Fhit gene
therapy in NSCLC.
