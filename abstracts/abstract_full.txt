CD69 is an activation marker on leukocytes. Early studies showed that the CD69+
cells were detected in the lung of patients with asthmatic and eosinophilic
pneumonia, suggesting that CD69 might play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of
such inflammatory diseases, rather than simply being an activation marker.
Intensive studies using mouse models have since clarified that CD69 is a
functional molecule regulating the immune responses. We discovered that Myosin
light chain 9, 12a, 12b (Myl9/12) are ligands for CD69 and that platelet-derived 
Myl9 forms a net-like structure (Myl9 nets) that is strongly detected inside
blood vessels in inflamed lung. CD69-expressing activated T cells attached to the
Myl9 nets can thereby migrate into the inflamed tissues through a system known as
the CD69-Myl9 system. In this review, we summarize the discovery of the CD69-Myl9
system and discuss how this system is important in inflammatory immune responses.
In addition, we discuss our recent finding that CD69 controls the exhaustion
status of tumor-infiltrating T cells and that the blockade of the CD69 function
enhances anti-tumor immunity. Finally, we discuss the possibility of CD69 as a
new therapeutic target for patients with intractable inflammatory disorders and
tumors.

CASE REPORT: Case 1 of an investigator-initiated study using oral single agent
mifepristone to halt stage IV non-small cell lung cancer whose tumor was devoid
of any targeted markers has remained ECOG zero and in good health for over 3
years. Case 2, reported here, is a 68-year-old woman with stage IV non-small cell
lung cancer whose tumor was positive for the programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1)
marker. Her cancer progressed despite treatment with a check-point inhibitor
(nivolumab), besides 3 rounds of multi-agent chemotherapy. After 1 ½ years of
treatment with single agent mifepristone, her cancer remains stable (even some
tumor regression) and her quality of life is only impaired by her pre-existing
chronic obstructive lung disease, not her cancer.
CONCLUSION: Mifepristone therapy may provide a method to halt metastatic lung
cancer positive for the PD-L1 marker when check-point inhibitors are no longer
effective.

EZH2 is a core component of the polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2), which
catalyzes trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and promotes
carcinogenesis by epigenetically silencing many tumor suppressor genes. Increased
EZH2 expression is a marker of advanced and metastatic in many cancers, including
lung, prostate and breast cancer, and it has been considered as a potential novel
therapeutic target. However, the clinical significance and molecular mechanisms
of EZH2 controlling gastric cancer cell proliferation and invasion are not well
documented. In this study, immunohistochemical analysis was conducted to
investigate the EZH2 expression in gastric cancer. We found that EZH2 levels were
increased in gastric cancer tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues.
Moreover, patients with high levels of EZH2 expression had a relatively poor
prognosis. Furthermore, knockdown of EZH2 expression by siRNA could impair cell
proliferation and invasion both in vitro and vivo. Finally, we found that EZH2
influences gastric cancer cells proliferation partly through regulating p21
expression. Our findings present that EZH2 over-expression can be identified as a
poor prognostic biomarker in gastric cancer.

Multiplex electrochemical sensors for amperometric detection of glutathione
disulfide (GSSG), glutathione (GSH), cysteine (Cys), cystine (Cyss),
β-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP+) and coenzyme II reduced
tetrasodium salt (NADPH) were developed, in which analysis of Cyss, NADP+ and
NADPH are the first report using this sensing system. Specificity of these
sensors were ensured by a layer of molecularly imprinted polymer (MIP) which was 
electropolymerized in situ with the analytes as template. All the sensors were
tested with standard buffers and mouse blood samples, showing satisfactory
performance towards the corresponding analytes. Dynamic concentration for the six
analytes was in the range of 10-11-10-8 mol/L with the detection limit down to 20
pmol/L. In addition, artificially synthesized MIP film on the electrodes allowed 
for good selectivity and stability. Real blood sample measurement proved that the
sensors owned decent accuracy with recovery value ranging from 92%~112%. More
importantly, blood samples from lung cancer patients and healthy donors were
assayed by using the proposed sensors. Redox potentials (Ehc) were calculated
based on the contents of these endogenic substances, which were utilized to
reflect the health status of human body and help diagnose lung cancer. The levels
of GSH, NADPH and the absolute value of Ehc(GSH/GSSG) in patients with lung
cancer are significantly lower (P < 0.01) than those in healthy people, while the
contents of GSSG (P < 0.01) are higher. The blood test results suggested that the
content of GSH, NADPH, NADP+ and Ehc(GSH/GSSG) might serve as biomarkers for lung
cancer prediagnosis. These novel sensors for liquid biospy of cancer have
cost-benefit and scalability advantage over current techniques, potentially
enabling broader clinical access and efficient population screening.

BACKGROUND: Development of noninvasive biomarkers could potentially contribute to
extending the 5-year overall survival rate of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
patients. Circulating microRNAs (miRNAs), due to their high stability, have the
potential to become valuable cancer biomarkers.
METHODS: Using reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction and
testing three methods for data normalization, the expression levels of six miRNAs
were evaluated in serum samples obtained from 50 NSCLC patients. Subsequently,
the clinical significance of tested miRNAs was determined.
RESULTS: Significant downregulation of miR-21-5p, miR-30a-5p, and miR-126-3p and 
upregulation of miR-210-3p and miR-486-5p in serum samples of NSCLC patients were
identified in comparison to healthy controls. miR-205-5p appeared to be
undetectable in all tested samples. Furthermore, miR-210-3p was differentially
expressed between two subtypes of NSCLC. Receiver operating characteristic
analysis for miR-210-3p revealed the area under the curve of 0.842 (95%
confidence interval, 0.72-0.96; p = 0.0003) and demonstrated that miR-210-3p
displayed considerable accuracy in discriminating serum of lung adenocarcinoma
(AC) patients from serum of healthy controls.
CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this preliminary study indicate that five of six
tested miRNAs were deregulated in serum of NSCLC patients. Moreover, miR-210-3p
appears to be a promising biomarker for diagnosis of lung AC.

Hypoxia plays an extensive role in the development of the tumor microenvironment 
(TME), particularly in mediating immunosuppression. Respiratory hyperoxia therapy
has the potential to improve the effects of conventional cancer therapies via
molecular mechanisms mediating antitumor immunity. Here, we investigated whether 
hyperoxia therapy can restore tumor immunity and inhibit lung metastases in a
mouse model of triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) by treating a 4T1 mammary
carcinoma mouse model with normoxia (21% oxygen) or hyperoxia (60% oxygen)
therapy, after tumor development. Using flow cytometry analysis, we observed
significant organ-specific expansion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) 
and protein expression upregulation of the programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in
the hypoxic TME of 4T1 tumor-bearing mice maintained under normoxia conditions,
with the TME converting to a T-cell immune-suppressive state as early as the
premetastatic phase. Markedly, hyperoxia treatments ameliorated hypoxia levels in
the lung TME and decreased the proportion of MDSCs and the expression of PD-L1 in
both the primary tumor and in the metastatic lung, when compared to animals
treated with respiratory normoxia therapy. In addition, the number of lung
metastatic nodes fell from 90 per lung in the normoxic treated group to 13 per
lung in the hyperoxic treated group (P < 0.05), with the latter having limited
hyperoxia effects on primary tumor growth (mammary glands). Notably, hyperoxia
therapy was characterized by the differential recruitment of CD4+ and CD8+
T-cells. Thus, our study confirms that hyperoxia therapy may be used to overcome 
TME immunosuppression and control the extend of lung metastases in TNBC.
Importantly, changes in immunosuppressive MDSCs frequency and PD-L1 expression
levels may serve as biomarkers of hypoxia levels in cancer affected tissues that 
can benefit from hyperoxia treatments.

Long follow up is needed in prospective cohort study evaluation of plasma
biomarkers for incident peripheral arterial disease (PAD) Middle-aged PAD-free
individuals from the cardiovascular cohort of the Malmö Diet and Cancer study
(n = 5550; 1991-94) were followed prospectively for a median time of 23.4 years. 
The plasma biomarkers lipoprotein-associated phospholipase A2 (Lp-PLA2) activity 
and mass, proneurotensin, and CRP, were studied in relation to incidence of PAD
until December 31st, 2016. The diagnosis of PAD could be validated and confirmed 
in 98%. Cox regression was used to calculate hazard ratios (HR) per 1 standard
deviation increment of each respective log transformed plasma biomarker.
Cumulative incidence of PAD was 4.4% (men 5.9%, women 3.3%). Adjusting for age,
gender, smoking, body mass index, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, Lp-PLA2
activity (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.17-1.52), Lp-PLA2 mass (HR 1.20; 95% CI 1.05-1.37)
and CRP (HR 1.55; 95% CI 1.36-1.76) remained independently associated with
incident PAD. The plasma biomarkers Lp-PLA2 activity and mass, and CRP were
markers of PAD risk, implying that they might be useful biomarkers for
subclinical atherosclerosis and atherosclerotic disease.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the expression of vinculin in non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and to analyze its correlation with clinical features
and prognosis of NSCLC.
METHODS: The expression of vinculin in cancer tissues and paracancer tissues was 
detected by real-time PCR, western blotting, and immunohistochemistry.
Correlations between vinculin-positive expression and clinical features were
analyzed by Pearson correlation analysis, and those between vinculin expression
and prognosis were analyzed by Cox multivariate analysis.
RESULTS: Vinculin expression was significantly lower in cancer tissues than in
paracancer tissues. Pearson correlation analysis showed that vinculin expression 
was significantly correlated with tumor-node-metastasis (TNM) stage and lymph
node metastasis in NSCLC. Cox multivariate analysis showed that vinculin-negative
expression and TNM stage were independent risk factors for NSCLC prognosis.
Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that the 5-year overall survival (OS) rate was
20.51% for all NSCLC patients, and was significantly higher for vinculin-positive
patients with NSCLC than vinculin-negative patients.
CONCLUSIONS: Vinculin gene transcription is inhibited in NSCLC, and low vinculin 
expression promotes malignancy in NSCLC. Therefore, vinculin could be used as a
prognostic marker for NSCLC and a potential target for its treatment.

BACKGROUND: Plakophilin 1 (PKP1) is an important plaque component of desmosomes, 
major intercellular adhesive junctions that act as anchorage points for
intermediate filaments. Abnormal expression of PKP1 was observed in various types
of cancer, however so far its function in lung cancer has not yet been
elucidated.
METHODS: The expression of PKP1 was analyzed by RT-PCR and western blotting in
lung cancer cell lines. The protein expression of PKP1 was evaluated by
immunohistochemistry in tissue microarray. The epigenetic mechanism of PKP1 was
explored by demethylation test, bisulfite sequencing and
Methylation-Specific-PCR. The function of PKP1 was investigated by stable
transfection with an expression vector.
RESULTS: We found that PKP1 was downregulated in 6 out of 8 lung cancer cell
lines, and downregulation of PKP1 was associated with DNA hypermethylation. In
advanced primary lung tumor samples, higher expression of PKP1 was significantly 
associated with favorable clinical outcome (p = .003). Ectopic expression of PKP1
inhibited cell proliferation, colony formation, migration/invasion and enhanced
apoptosis. These phenomena are accompanied by increased caspase 3/7 activities
and cleaved PARP-1 as well as decreased extracellular signal-regulated kinase
(ERK) activity.
CONCLUSION: Taken together, our data suggest that PKP1 is a novel tumor
suppressor and its protein expression might be a potential prognostic marker for 
patients with advanced lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: Genetic alterations, including mutation of epidermal growth factor
receptor or v-Ki-ras2 kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog and fusion of
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), RET proto-oncogene (RET), or v-ros UR2 sarcoma 
virus oncogene homolog 1 (ROS1), occur in non-small cell lung cancers, and these 
oncogenic drivers are important biomarkers for targeted therapies. A useful
technique to screen for these fusions is the detection of native carboxy-terminal
(C-terminal) protein by immunohistochemistry; however, the effects of other
genetic alterations on C-terminal expression is not fully understood. In this
study, we evaluated whether C-terminal expression is specifically elevated by
fusion with or without typical genetic alterations of lung cancer.
METHODS: In 37 human lung cancer cell lines and four tissue specimens, protein
and mRNA levels were measured by capillary western blotting and reverse
transcription-PCR, respectively.
RESULTS: Compared with the median of all 37 cell lines, mRNA levels at the
C-terminus of all five of the fusion-positive cell lines tested (three ALK, one
RET, and one ROS1) were elevated at least 2000-, 300-, or 2000-fold,
respectively, and high C-terminal protein expression was detected. In an ALK
fusion-positive tissue specimen, the mRNA and protein levels of C-terminal ALK
were also markedly elevated. Meanwhile, in one of 36 RET fusion-negative cell
lines, RET mRNA levels at the C-terminus were elevated at least 500-fold compared
with the median of all 37 cell lines, and high C-terminal protein expression was 
detected despite the absence of RET fusion.
CONCLUSIONS: This study of 37 cell lines and four tissue specimens shows the
detection of C-terminal ALK or ROS1 proteins could be a comprehensive method to
determine ALK or ROS1 fusion, whereas not only the detection of C-terminal RET
protein but also other methods would be needed to determine RET fusion.

BACKGROUND: Lysosomal-associated protein transmembrane-4 beta (LAPTM4B), a novel 
oncogene, promotes tumorigenesis and may be a potential prognostic biomarker in
several cancers. This study was to determine the clinical significance and
biological roles of LAPTM4B in lung adenocarcinoma (LAC).
METHODS: LAPTM4B expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of 63 LAC 
tumors. Serum levels of LAPTM4B were measured by enzyme-linked immuosorbent
assays (ELISA). The study included untreated group (n = 216), chemotherapy group 
(n = 29), chemotherapy efficacy group (n = 179), EGFR-TKIs group (n = 57) and 68 
healthy controls. Statistical analysis was performed to explore the correlation
between LAPTM4B expression and clinicopathological parameters in LAC.
Kaplan-Meier analysis was performed to assess the prognostic significance of
LAPTM4B in LAC. In vitro assays were performed to assess the biological roles of 
LAPTM4B in LAC cells. Western blotting assays were examined to identify the
underlying pathways involved in the tumor-promoting role of LAPTM4B.
RESULTS: We found LAPTM4B was upregulated in LAC tissues and high LAPTM4B
expression was significantly correlated with poor prognosis. Serum LAPTM4B levels
were significantly decreased after chemotherapy. Patients in invalid response
group showed higher LAPTM4B levels than the valid response group. Overexpression 
of LAPTM4B promoted, while silencing of LAPTM4B inhibited proliferation, invasion
and migration of LAC cells via PI3K/AKT and EMT signals. LAPTM4B expression level
was associated with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene mutations. In
addition, LAPTM4B plays important roles in EGFR-promoted cell proliferation,
migration and invasion and gefitinib-induced apoptosis.
CONCLUSIONS: Collectively, our data propose that LAPTM4B may be a cancer
biomarker for LAC and a potential therapeutic target which facilitates the
development of a novel therapeutic strategy against LAC.

PURPOSE: The detection of pre-existing EGFR T790M subclones and the assessment of
their clinical significance in the pretreatment of EGFR T790M non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) patients remain unclear.
EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A total of 179 tumor samples from patients treated or not
with a first-generation Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor (TKI) was analyzed. The
presence of ultra-low levels of pre-existing EGFRT790M mutation was evaluated
using ultra-sensitive droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) and the clinical implication of
these mutations on first-generation TKI efficiency assessed.
RESULTS: With a ddPCR linear performance of 0.999 and an analytical sensitivity
of approximately 0.001%, we observed a 66% (99/150) overall incidence of
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutation. Among 82 patients harboring EGFR activating
mutations, the presence of a pre-existing EGFR T790M mutation prior to any
treatment was significantly associated with a longer PFS (P = 0.009; Log-rank
test). Interestingly, longer PFS was linked to concomitant EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations. Moreover, the presence of both EGFR del19 and
ultra-low EGFR T790M mutations was identified as the best fit for predicting the 
clinical outcome of patients treated with TKI compared with an ultra-low EGFR
T790M mutation status or an activating mutation alone (P = 0.042 and P = 0.0071, 
respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrate that the detection of the ultra-low EGFR T790M
mutation in TKI-naive patients is not a rare event. We suggest that ddPCR should 
be used in clinical practice to distinguish patients who may respond to first- or
third-generation TKIs.

Checkpoint inhibitor-based immunotherapy is opening a promising scenario in
oncology, with objective responses registered in multiple cancer types. However, 
reliable predictive markers of tumor responsiveness are still lacking. These
markers need to be urgently identified for a better selection of patients that
can be candidates for immunotherapy. In this pilot study, a cohort of 34
consecutive patients bearing programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)-positive non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), treated with pembrolizumab, was considered. The
retrospective immuno-phenotypic analysis performed on the original tumor biopsies
allowed for the identification of a specific "galectin signature", which strongly
correlated with tumor responsiveness to anti PD-1 immunotherapy. We observed that
the large majority of patients (about 90%) with high galectin-3 tumor expression 
(score 3+) showed an early and dramatic progression of the disease after three
cycles of treatments. In contrast, all patients with negative or low/intermediate
expression of galectin-3 in tumor cells showed an early and durable objective
response to pembrolizumab, indicating galectin-3 as an interesting predictive
marker of tumor responsiveness. The galectin-3 signature, at least in NSCLCs,
promises a better selection of patient candidates for immunotherapy, reducing
unnecessary treatment exposures and social costs. A large multicenter study is
ongoing to validate this finding.

Lung cancer, one of the most frequently diagnosed cancers worldwide has long
relied on testing for the molecular biomarkers EGFR/ALK. However, achieving
superior clinical outcomes for patients with lung cancer requires developing
comprehensive techniques beyond contemporary EGFR/ALK testing. Current
technologies are on par with molecular testing for EGFR/ALK in terms of efficacy,
most of them failing to offer improvements perhaps primarily due to skepticism
among clinicians, despite being recommended in the NCCN guidelines. The present
study endeavored to minimize chemotherapy-dependence in EGFR/ALK-negative patient
cohorts, and use evidence-based methods to identify ways to improve clinical
outcomes. In total, 137 lung cancer cases obtained from 'PositiveSelect NGS
data', comprising 91 males and 46 females, were investigated. EGFR- and
ALK-positivity was used for data dichotomization to understand the therapeutic
utility of rare gene alterations beyond just EGFR/ALK. Statistics obtained from
PositiveSelect were collated with data from international studies to construct a 
meta-analysis intended to achieve better clinical outcomes. Upon dichotomization,
23% of cases harbored EGFR variants indicating that treating with EGFR TKIs would
be beneficial; the remaining 77% exhibited no EGFR variants that would indicate
favorable results using specific currently available chemotherapy practices.
Similarly, 28% of cases had EGFR+ALK variants favoring EGFR/ALK-based targeted
therapeutics; the remaining 72% harbored no EGFR/ALK variants with known
beneficial chemotherapy routes. The present study aimed to overcome current
inadequacies of targeted therapies in patients with a conventional
EGFR/ALK-positive diagnosis and those in EGFR+ALK-negative cohorts. Upon analysis
of the negative cohorts, significant and clinically relevant single nucleotide
variants were identified in KRAS, ERBB2, MET and RET, with frequencies of 7, 1, 2
and 3% in patients who were EGFR-negative and 6, 1, 1, and 3% in patients who
were EGFR and ALK-negative, respectively, enabling the use of targeted
therapeutics aside from EGFR/ALK TKIs. From the results of the current study only
35% of the two negative arms (EGFR negative and EGFR+ALK negative) would be
recommended NCCN or off-label chemotherapy; prior to the current study, the
entire cohorts would have been recommended this treatment. The present study
emphasizes the potential of comprehensive genomics in identifying hallmarks of
lung cancer beyond EGFR/ALK, using broad-spectrum genetic testing and
data-sharing among medical professionals to circumvent ineffective chemotherapy.

Medical University, Nanning, Guangxi 530021, P.R. China.

The aim of the present study was to investigate the potential prognostic value of
members of the heat shock protein (HSP)90 family in non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) patients. The mRNA expression profiles of 1,926 NSCLC patients, which was
available from the Kaplan-Meier plotter database, were included in the study.
High expression of HSP90AA1 mRNA was significantly associated with a poorer rate 
of overall survival (OS) for all NSCLC patients [hazard ratio (HR), 1.21; 95%
confidence interval (CI): 1.06-1.37; P=0.004], as well as for patients with
adenocarcinoma (ADE; HR, 1.3; 95% CI: 1.02-1.65; P=0.034), but no significant
correlation was identified for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) patients (HR, 1.08; 
95% CI: 0.85-1.38; P=0.51). High expression of HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 mRNA was
significantly associated with poorer rates of OS in lung SCC and ADE patients
combined, as well as in lung ADE patients alone. By contrast, high expression of 
tumor necrosis factor receptor-associated protein 1 (TRAP1) mRNA was
significantly associated with improved OS rates in all NSCLC patients combined
(HR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.77-0.99; P=0.041), as well as ADE patients. In stratified
survival analysis, a high expression of HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1 and HSP90B1 predicted 
poor prognosis in stage I NSLCC patients, suggesting that these genes may serve
as stage-independent prognostic indicators. As an elevated expression of
HSP90AA1, HSP90AB1, HSP90B1 and TRAP1 was associated with poorer OS outcomes in
patients with NSCLC, these HSP90 members may be potential prognostic biomarkers
and drug targets for the treatment of NSCLC.

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary cancer of the liver
with high mortality and frequent recurrence. Although various therapies provide
potential cure for HCC patients, unfortunately the five-year survival rate of
advanced HCC remains dismal. It is critical to explore the pathogenesis of HCC
and identify novel biomarkers for early HCC diagnosis. PSMD4 is a major receptor 
of the 26S proteasome involved in ubiquitindependent and proteasome-mediated
protein degradation. In our study, PSMD4 was overexpressed in HCC tissues and
cell lines determined by Northern blot, western blot and immunohistochemistry.
The silencing of PSMD4 blocked cell proliferation and tumor growth, induced cell 
apoptosis and inhibited the proteasome activity. Western blot results showed that
the knockdown of PSMD4 blocked the expression of cyclooxygenase 2 (COX2),
phosphorylated Sarcoma tyrosine kinase (P-SRC) and Bcl-2, but improved the levels
of p53 and Bax in HCC, lung cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer and
endometrial cancer cell lines. Taken together, these findings indicated that the 
subunit of 26S proteasome PSMD4 exerts as an oncogene in HCC and other cancers
via regulating the expression p53, Bcl-2 and Bax. These findings enriched the
pathogenesis of HCC, and provided a new biomarker for cancers diagnosis and a new
target for cancers therapy.

INTRODUCTION: Orthopedia homeobox protein (OTP) was recently demonstrated to be a
pulmonary neuroendocrine marker showing specificity for pulmonary carcinoid
tumors in histologic sections. Little is known of OTP performance and specificity
for pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors in lung fine-needle aspiration (FNA) cell
blocks (CBs), however.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We evaluated OTP expression in lung non-neuroendocrine and
neuroendocrine tumor CBs to determine its diagnostic utility in these specimens. 
Pulmonary typical carcinoid (TC) and atypical carcinoid (AC), small-cell lung
cancer (SCLC) and large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC), and squamous cell 
carcinoma (SQ) and adenocarcinoma (ADC) CBs were retrieved along with matched
surgical cases and assessed for nuclear OTP expression with immunohistochemistry.
RESULTS: Nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 11) and 83% ACs (10 of 12), but
not in SCLC (0 of 9), LCNEC (0 of 9), SQ (0 of 10) or ADC (0 of 6) cytology
cases. Similar to the cytologic specimens, nuclear OTP was seen in 82% TCs (9 of 
11) and 80% ACs (8 of 10) but in none of the SCLC (0 of 8), LCNEC (0 of 7), SQ (0
of 8) or ADC (0 of 6) resections. Both AC and TC CBs showed a similar percentage 
of cells expressing nuclear OTP. By contrast, in resection specimens, 30% ACs (3 
of 10) compared with 73% TC (8 of 11) cases showed >40% of cells nuclear OTP
staining. Nuclear OTP demonstrated 80-83% sensitivity and 100% specificity for
pulmonary carcinoid tumors in cytology and surgical specimens.
CONCLUSION: In the context of pulmonary malignancies, nuclear OTP
immunohistochemistry is highly sensitive and specific in distinguishing carcinoid
tumors from other pulmonary neuroendocrine and non-neuroendocrine malignancies in
cytologic and surgical specimens.

Arecoline is the primary alkaloid in betel nuts, which are known as a risk factor
for oral submucosal fibrosis and oral cancer. Lung cancer is a severe type of
carcinoma with high cell motility that is difficult to treat. However, the
detailed mechanisms of the correlation between Arecoline and lung cancer are not 
fully understood. Here, we investigated the effect of Arecoline on migration in
lung cancer cell lines and its potential mechanism through the muscarinic
acetylcholine receptor 3 (mAChR3)-triggered EGFR/Src/FAK pathway. Our results
indicate that different concentrations of Arecoline treatment (10 µM, 20 µM, and 
40 µM) significantly increased the cell migration ability in A549 and CL1-0 cells
and promoted the formation of the filamentous actin (F-actin) cytoskeleton, which
is a crucial element for cell migration. However, migration of H460, CL1-5, and
H520 cell lines, which have a higher migration ability, was not affected by
Arecoline treatment. The EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway, which is responsible for cell
migration, was activated by Arecoline treatment, and a decreased expression level
of E-cadherin, which is an epithelial marker, was observed in Arecoline-treated
cell lines. Blockade of the EGFR/c-Src/Fak pathway with the inhibitors of EGFR
(Gefitinib) or c-Src (Dasatinib) significantly prevented Arecoline-promoted
migration in A549 cells. Gefitinib or Dasatinib treatment significantly disrupted
the Arecoline-induced localization of phospho-Y576-Fak during focal adhesion in
A549 cells. Interestingly, Arecoline-promoted migration in A549 cells was blocked
by a specific mAChR3 inhibitor (4-DAMP) or a neutralizing antibody of matrix
metalloproteinase (MMP7 or Matrilysin). Taken together, our findings suggest that
mAChR3 might play an essential role in Arecoline-promoted EGFR/c-Src/Fak
activation and migration in an A549 lung cancer cell line.

Smoking cessation prolongs survival and decreases mortality of patients with
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In addition, epigenetic alterations of some
genes are associated with survival. However, potential interactions between
smoking cessation and epigenetics have not been assessed. Here, we conducted an
epigenome-wide interaction analysis between DNA methylation and smoking cessation
on NSCLC survival. We used a two-stage study design to identify DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interactions that affect overall survival for
early-stage NSCLC. The discovery phase contained NSCLC patients from USA, Spain, 
Norway, and Sweden. A histology-stratified Cox proportional hazards model
adjusted for age, sex, clinical stage, and study center was used to test DNA
methylation-smoking cessation interaction terms. Interactions with FDR-q ≤ 0.05
were further confirmed in a validation phase using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
database. Histology-specific interactions were identified by stratification
analysis in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinoma (LUSC)
patients. We identified one CpG probe (cg02268510SIPA 1L3 ) that significantly
and exclusively modified the effect of smoking cessation on survival in LUAD
patients (HRinteraction = 1.12; 95% CI: 1.07-1.16; P = 4.30×10-7 ). Further, the 
effect of smoking cessation on early-stage LUAD survival varied across patients
with different methylation levels of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Smoking cessation only 
benefited LUAD patients with low methylation (HR = 0.53; 95% CI: 0.34-0.82; P =
4.61×10-3 ) rather than medium or high methylation (HR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.86-1.70;
P = 0.266) of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . Moreover, there was an antagonistic
interaction between elevated methylation of cg02268510SIPA 1L3 and smoking
cessation (HRinteraction = 2.1835; 95% CI: 1.27-3.74; P = 4.46 × 10-3 ). In
summary, smoking cessation benefited survival of LUAD patients with low
methylation at cg02268510SIPA 1L3 . The results have implications for not only
smoking cessation after diagnosis, but also possible methylation-specific drug
targeting.

PURPOSE: Cancer stem cells (CSC) and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)
pathways are crucial for cancer progression. However, synergistic interactions
between CSC and EMT are not clear in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study was to investigate CSC markers such as CD44, NANOG, and
ALDH1 expression and its correlation with EMT markers in NSCLC patients. Its
association with survival was also determined.
METHODS: CD44, NANOG, and ALDH1 protein expression was evaluated in 267 resected 
NSCLC and its correlation with e-cadherin, β-catenin, p120 catenin, vimentin,
SNAIL, and TWIST expressions was determined based on immunohistochemical and mRNA
expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Survival analyses
also were performed based on immunohistochemistry and mRNA expression data from
Gene Expression Omnibus dataset.
RESULTS: ALDH1 expression in lung adenocarcinoma was positively correlated with
the epithelial-like phenotype, low vimentin and low TWIST in immunohistochemical 
and mRNA expression data. NANOG and ALDH1 expressions measured by
immunohistochemical and mRNA expression profiling data of adenocarcinomas were
associated with a favorable prognosis. ALDH1 was an independent favorable
prognostic marker for overall survival or recurrence-free survival in
adenocarcinoma (P = 0.026 and P = 0.033, respectively). The epithelial-like
phenotype expressing P120-catenin and beta-catenin was associated with a
favorable prognosis; however, the TWIST-expressing mesenchymal-like phenotype was
correlated with an unfavorable prognosis.
CONCLUSIONS: NANOG and ALDH1 protein or mRNA expression showed improved prognosis
in adenocarcinoma alone. ALDH1 expression correlated with an epithelial-like
phenotype.

PURPOSE: Radiation-induced cardiac toxicity (RICT) is an increasingly
well-appreciated source of morbidity and mortality in patients receiving thoracic
radiotherapy (RT). Currently available methods to predict RICT are suboptimal. We
investigated circulating microRNAs (c-miRNAs) as potential biomarkers of RICT in 
patients undergoing definitive RT for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Data from 63 patients treated on institutional trials were analyzed.
Prognostic models of grade 3 or greater (G3 +) RICT based on pre-treatment
c-miRNA levels ('c-miRNA'), mean heart dose (MHD) and pre-existing cardiac
disease (PCD) ('clinical'), and a combination of these ('c-miRNA + clinical')
were developed. Elastic net Cox regression and full cross validation were used
for variable selection, model building, and model evaluation. Concordance
statistic (c-index) and integrated Brier score (IBS) were used to evaluate model 
performance.
RESULTS: MHD, PCD, and serum levels of 14 c-miRNA species were identified as
jointly prognostic for G3 + RICT. The 'c-miRNA and 'clinical' models yielded
similar cross-validated c-indices (0.70 and 0.72, respectively) and IBSs (0.26
and 0.28, respectively). However, prognostication was not improved by combining
c-miRNA and clinical factors (c-index 0.70, IBS 0.28). The 'c-miRNA' and
'clinical' models were able to significantly stratify patients into high- and
low-risk groups of developing G3 + RICT. Chi-square testing demonstrated a
marginally significantly higher prevalence of PCD in patients with high- compared
to low-risk c-miRNA profile (p = 0.09), suggesting an association between some
c-miRNAs and PCD.
CONCLUSIONS: We identified a pre-treatment c-miRNA signature prognostic for
G3 + RICT. With further development, pre- and mid-treatment c-miRNA profiling
could contribute to patient-specific dose selection and treatment adaptation.

Summary: Former uranium miners of the Wismut Company, East Germany, have been
exposed to ionizing radiation from radon decay products and therefore were at
high risk for lung cancer. Since histological types of cancer in the so called
Wismut cohort revealed an association of high radon exposure with a higher
relative frequency of squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC), we used comparative
proteomic analysis to identify differentially expressed proteins in serum exposed
uranium miners with SqCC.
Methode: Pooled sera of exposed former uranium miners without lung disease and
pooled sera of former uranium miners with SqCC were analysed by 2-D gel
electrophoresis. MALDI-TOF-MS was performed from reproducable, significantly, at 
least 5-fold up-regulated protein spots. Proteins were identified by MASCOT
peptide mass fingerprint search. Additionally a receiver operating characteristic
curve for CYFRA 21-1 was created.
Results: The protein spots were identified as Keratin 10 (K10), Keratin 1 (K1),
complement factor H (CFH) and a haptoglobin (Hpt) fragment. The sensitivity for
CYFRA 21-1 reveals 60% at a specifity of 95 and 80% at a specifity of 80%.
Plotting the sensitivity against specifity reveals an AUC of 0.88.
Conclusion: In SqCC Keratin 10 and 1 were strongly induced. This was associated
with CYFRA 21-1, confirming the cytokeratin fragment as a tumormarker.

Conflict of interest statement: Former German uranium miners were offered a
medical surveillance programme (including laboratory parameters, x-ray
examination of the lungs, lung function and examination) by the ZeBWis (Zentrale 
Betreuungsstelle Wismut), a special department of the German Occupational
Accident Insurance Associations responsible for health care and support of former
SAG/SDAG Wismut employees. The German federal ministry for the environment
enabled the establishment of the so called Wismut cohort to preserve the health
data. A multicenter project investigating biomarkers with regard to lung cancer
has been implemented and published earlier. All participants gave their consent
to this project. At that time no ethical approval was required since the
individuals participated voluntarily in the study. All data were analyzed
anonymously. In the present study only former data and already frozen sera were
analysed with modern laboratory methods, which were not available at that time.
For the purpose of assessment and quality assurance no further ethic votes were
required.The manuscript does not contain individual person’s data in any form.The

BACKGROUND: Clinically-available biomarkers to identify the fraction of patients 
with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) who respond to immune-checkpoint inhibitors
(ICIs) are lacking. High nonsynonymous tumor mutational burden (TMB), as assessed
by whole exome sequencing, correlates with improved clinical outcomes for
patients with SCLC treated with ICIs. Whether TMB as assessed by targeted next
generation sequencing (NGS) is associated with improved efficacy of ICIs in
patients with SCLC is currently unknown. Here we determined whether TMB by
targeted NGS is associated with efficacy of ICIs in patients with SCLC.
METHODS: We collected clinicopathologic data from patients with relapsed or
refractory SCLC which underwent targeted NGS with TMB assessment by the
Dana-Farber Cancer Institute OncoPanel platform. The relationship between TMB and
clinical outcomes after treatment with ICIs was investigated.
RESULTS: Among the 52 patients treated with ICIs, we found no significant
difference in the objective response rate (ORR) between patients with a TMB above
the 50th percentile ("TMB high") and those with a TMB at or below the 50th
percentile ("TMB low"). The median progression-free survival (mPFS) and median
overall survival (mOS) were significantly longer in patients with a high TMB
compared to those with a low TMB (mPFS: 3.3 versus 1.2 months, HR: 0.37 [95% CI: 
0.20-0.69], P < 0.01; mOS: 10.4 versus 2.5 months, HR: 0.38 [95% CI: 0.19-0.77], 
P < 0.01). The one-year PFS and OS rates improved with increasing mutational load
when TMB was divided into tertiles.
CONCLUSIONS: These findings show that targeted NGS, a readily available clinical 
diagnostic test, can be used to identify patients with SCLC who are most likely
to benefit from treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

MicroRNAs (miRs) are important posttranscriptional regulators of gene expression.
Besides their well-characterized inhibitory effects on mRNA stability and
translation, miRs can also activate gene expression. In this study, we identified
a novel noncanonical function of miR-574-5p. We found that miR-574-5p acts as an 
RNA decoy to CUG RNA-binding protein 1 (CUGBP1) and antagonizes its function.
MiR-574-5p induces microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) expression by 
preventing CUGBP1 binding to its 3'UTR, leading to an enhanced alternative
splicing and generation of an mPGES-1 3'UTR isoform, increased mPGES-1 protein
expression, PGE2 formation, and tumor growth in vivo. miR-574-5p-induced tumor
growth in mice could be completely inhibited with the mPGES-1 inhibitor CIII.
Moreover, miR-574-5p is induced by IL-1β and is strongly overexpressed in human
nonsmall cell lung cancer where high mPGES-1 expression correlates with a low
survival rate. The discovered function of miR-574-5p as a CUGBP1 decoy opens up
new therapeutic opportunities. It might serve as a stratification marker to
select lung tumor patients who respond to the pharmacological inhibition of PGE2 
formation.-Saul, M. J., Baumann, I., Bruno, A., Emmerich, A. C., Wellstein, J.,

Currently, there are few studies on patients with nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma,
and the pathogenesis is still unclear. The role of DNA methylation in the
pathogenesis of cancer is gradually being recognized. The purpose of this study
was to determine the abnormal methylation genes and pathways involved in
nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Gene expression microarray data
(GSE10072, GSE43458) and gene methylation microarray data (GSE62948) were
downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database and differentially
expressed genes were obtained through GEO2R. Next, we analyzed the function and
enrichment of the selected genes using Database for Annotation, Visualization,
and Integrated Discovery. The protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks were
constructed using the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes database
and visualized in Cytoscape. Finally, we performed module analysis of the PPI
network using Molecular Complex Detection. And we obtained 10 hub genes by
Cytoscape Centiscape. We analyzed the independent prognostic value of each hub
gene in nonsmoking nonsmall cell lung cancer patients through Kaplan-Meier
plotter. Seven hub genes (CXCL12, CDH1, CASP3, CREB1, COL1A1, ERBB2, and ENO2)
were closely related to the overall survival time. This study provides an
effective bioinformatics basis for further understanding the pathogenesis and
prognosis of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients. Hub genes with prognostic
value could be selected as effective biomarkers for timely diagnosis and
prognostic of nonsmoking lung adenocarcinoma patients.

Objectives: Molecular profiling of tumours has become the mainstay of diagnostics
for metastasised solid malignancies and guides personalised treatment, especially
in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In current practice, it is often
challenging to obtain sufficient tumour material for reliable molecular analysis.
Cell-free DNA (cfDNA) in blood or other bio-sources could present an alternative 
approach to obtain genetic information from the tumour. In a retrospective cohort
we analysed the added value of cfDNA analysis in pleural effusions for molecular 
profiling.
Methods: We retrospectively analysed both the supernatant and the cell pellet of 
44 pleural effusions sampled from 39 stage IV patients with KRAS (n=23) or EGFR
(n=16) mutated tumours to detect the original driver mutation as well as for EGFR
T790M resistance mutations. Patients were diagnosed with either NSCLC (n=32),
colon carcinoma (n=4), appendiceal carcinoma (n=2) or adenocarcinoma of unknown
primary (n=1). Samples collected in the context of routine clinical care were
stored at the Netherlands Cancer Institute biobank. We used droplet digital PCR
for analysis.
Results: The driver mutation could be detected in 36 of the 44 pleural effusions 
by analysis of both the supernatant (35 out of 44 positive) and the cell pellet
(31 out of 44 positive). In seven out of 20 pleural effusions from patients with 
EGFR mutation-positive tumours, a T790M mutation was detected. All seven
supernatants and cell pellets were positive.
Conclusions: cfDNA in pleural effusion can be used to detect driver mutations as 
well as resistance mechanisms like EGFR T790M in pleural effusion with high
accuracy and is therefore a valuable bio-source.

BACKGROUND: The advent of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has considerably
expanded the armamentarium against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
contributing to reshaping treatment paradigms in the advanced disease setting.
While promising tissue- and plasma-based biomarkers are under investigation, no
reliable predictive factor is currently available to aid in treatment selection.
METHODS: Patients with stage IIIB-IV NSCLC receiving nivolumab at Sant'Andrea
Hospital and Regina Elena National Cancer Institute from June 2016 to July 2017
were enrolled onto this study. Major clinicopathological parameters were
retrieved and correlated with patients' survival outcomes in order to assess
their prognostic value and build a useful tool to assist in the decision making
process.
RESULTS: A total of 102 patients were included in this study. The median age was 
69 years (range 44-85 years), 69 (68%) were male and 52% had ECOG PS 0.
Loco-regional/distant lymph nodes were the most commonly involved site of
metastasis (71%), followed by lung parenchyma (67%) and bone (26%). Overall
survival (OS) in the whole patients' population was 83.6%, 63.2% and 46.9% at 3, 
6 and 12 months, respectively; while progression-free survival (PFS) was 66.5%,
44.4% and 26.4% at 3, 6 and 12 months, respectively. At univariate analysis,
age ≥ 69 years (P = 0.057), ECOG PS (P < 0.001), the presence of liver
(P < 0.001), lung (P = 0.017) metastases, lymph nodes only involvement
(P = 0.0145) were significantly associated with OS and ECOG PS (P < 0.001) and
liver metastases (P < 0.001), retained statistical significance at multivariate
analysis. A prognostic nomogram based on three variables (liver and lung
metastases and ECOG PS) was built to assign survival probability at 3, 6, and
12 months after nivolumab treatment commencement.
CONCLUSION: We developed a nomogram based on easily available and inexpensive
clinical factors showing a good performance in predicting individual OS
probability among NSCLC patients treated with nivolumab. This prognostic device
could be valuable to clinicians in more accurately driving treatment decision in 
daily practice as well as enrollment onto clinical trials.

Lung cancer is one of the most lethal malignancies worldwide, mainly due to its
late diagnoses. The detection of molecular markers on samples provided from
routine bronchoscopy including several liquid-based cytology tests (e.g.,
bronchoaspirate, bronchoalveolar lavage) and/or on easily obtained specimens such
as sputum could represent a new approach to improve the sensitivity in lung
cancer diagnoses. Recently growing interest has been reported for "noninvasive"
liquid biopsy as a valuable source for molecular profiling. Unfortunately, a
biomarker and/or composition of biomarkers capable of detecting early-stage lung 
cancer has yet to be discovered even if in the last few years there has been,
through the use of revolutionary new technologies, an explosion of lung cancer
biomarkers. Assay sensitivity and specificity need to be improved particularly
when new approaches and/or tools are used. We have focused on the most important 
markers detected in tissue, and on several cytological specimens and liquid
biopsies overall.

Objective: To explore the correlation between programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression and clinicopathological features and prognosis of small cell lung
cancer (SCLC). Methods: The clinicopathological data of 64 patients with small
cell lung cancer from January 2013 to December 2016 in the First Affiliated
Hospital of Zhengzhou University were retrospectively analyzed in this study. The
correlation between PD-L1 expression and the clinicopathological features and
prognosis of SCLC was analyzed. Results: Immunohistochemical staining revealed
that PD-L1 expression was observed in 60.9% (39/64) of patients with small cell
lung cancer. PD-L1 expression was significantly related to stages (P<0.001).
Univariate analysis showed that the median overall survival of PD-L1 negative
group was longer than PD-L1 positive group (16 months vs 14 months, P<0.001).
Median progression-free survival of PD-L1 negative group was longer than PD-L1
positive group(15 months vs 9 months, P<0.000 1). In multivariate analysis, PD-L1
positive was significantly correlated with inferior progression-free survival
(P=0.006). Conclusions: PD-L1 expression rate was high in small cell lung cancer.
PD-L1 expression was an independent predictor for poor prognosis of patients with
small cell lung cancer.

示，PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位总生存时间为16个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(14个月，P<0.001)。PD－L1阴性表达组患者的中位无进展生存时间为1
5个月，明显长于PD－L1阳性表达组(9个月，P<0.000
1)。多因素分析结果显示，PD－L1的阳性表达是影响SCLC患者无进展生存时间的独立危险因素(P＝0.006)。 结论：
PD－L1在SCLC患者中高表达，PD－L1阳性表达是SCLC的独立不良预后因素。.

Glioblastoma (GBM) is highly refractory to therapy and associated with poor
clinical outcome. Here, we reveal a critical function of the promitotic and
adhesion-mediating discoidin domain receptor 1 (DDR1) in modulating GBM therapy
resistance. In GBM cultures and clinical samples, we show a DDR1 and GBM stem
cell marker co-expression that correlates with patient outcome. We demonstrate
that inhibition of DDR1 in combination with radiochemotherapy with temozolomide
in GBM models enhances sensitivity and prolongs survival superior to conventional
therapy. We identify a 14-3-3-Beclin-1-Akt1 protein complex assembling with DDR1 
to be required for prosurvival Akt and mTOR signaling and regulation of
autophagy-associated therapy sensitivity. Our results uncover a mechanism driven 
by DDR1 that controls GBM therapy resistance and provide a rationale target for
the development of therapy-sensitizing agents.

Cryptotanshinone (CTS) was reported to repress a variety of systemic inflammation
and alleviate cardiac fibrosis, but it is still unclear whether CTS could prevent
radiation-induced lung injury (RILI). Here, we investigated the effects and
underlying mechanisms of CTS on a RILI rat model. Our data revealed that CTS
could efficiently preserve pulmonary function in RILI rats and reduce early
pulmonary inflammation infiltration elicited, along with marked decreased levels 
of IL-6 and IL-10. Moreover, we found that CTS is superior to prednisone in
attenuating collagen deposition and pulmonary fibrosis, in parallel with a marked
drop of HYP (a collagen indicator) and α-SMA (a myofibroblast marker).
Mechanistically, CTS inhibited profibrotic signals TGF-β1 and NOX-4 expressions, 
while enhancing the levels of antifibrotic enzyme MMP-1 in lung tissues. It is
noteworthy that CTS treatment, in consistent with trichrome staining analysis,
exhibited a clear advantage over PND in enhancing MMP-1 levels. However, CTS
exhibited little effect on CTGF activation and on COX-2 suppression. Finally, CTS
treatment significantly mitigated the radiation-induced activation of CCL3 and
its receptor CCR1. In summary, CTS treatment could attenuate RILI, especially
pulmonary fibrosis, in rats. The regulation on production and release of
inflammatory or fibrotic factors IL-6, IL-10, TGF-β1, NOX-4, and MMP-1,
especially MMP-1 and inhibition on CCL3/CCR1 activation, may partly attribute to 
its attenuating RILI effect.

The roles of microRNAs (miRNAs) in lung cancer have not yet been explored
systematically at the genome scale despite their important regulatory functions. 
Here, we report an integrative analysis of microRNA and mRNA sequencing data for 
tumor and matched normal samples from 109 Korean female patients with
non-small-cell lung adenocarcinoma. We produced miRNA-Seq and RNA-Seq data for 48
patients and RNA-Seq data for 61 additional patients. Subsequent differential
expression analysis with stringent criteria yielded 44 miRNAs and 2,322 genes.
Integrative gene set analysis of the differentially expressed miRNAs and genes
using miRNA-target information revealed several regulatory processes related to
the cell cycle that were targeted by tumor suppressor miRNAs. We performed colony
formation assays in A549 and NCI-H460 cell lines to test the tumor suppressive
activity of down-regulated miRNAs in cancer and identified 7 novel tumor
suppressor miRNAs (miR-144-5p, miR-218-1-3p, miR-223-3p, miR-27a-5p, miR-30a-3p, 
miR-30c-2-3p, miR-338-5p). Two miRNAs, miR-30a-3p and miR-30c-2-3p, showed
differential survival characteristics in the TCGA LUAD patient cohort indicating 
their prognostic value. Finally, we identified a network cluster of miRNAs and
target genes that could be responsible for cell cycle regulation. Our study not
only provides a dataset of miRNA as well as mRNA sequencing from the matched
tumor-normal samples, but also reports several novel tumor suppressor miRNAs that
could potentially be developed into prognostic biomarkers or therapeutic RNA
drugs.

Antibodies that target programmed death 1 (PD-1) or its ligand (programmed death 
ligand 1 (PD-L1) have become a mainstay of first-line treatment of
advanced/metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without targetable genetic
alterations. In this review, we summarize results from recent clinical trials
that have evaluated the anti-PD-1 antibodies pembrolizumab and nivolumab and the 
anti-PD-L1 antibodies atezolizumab and durvalumab as first-line treatment as
monotherapy, in combination with chemotherapy, other immunotherapies, and
anti-angiogenesis agents. We discuss factors that may influence treatment
selection, including patient baseline clinical and demographic characteristics,
tumor histology, and biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and tumor mutation
burden. While immunotherapy has become a central component of first-line
treatment for most patients with advanced NSCLC, important questions remain about
how treatment should be managed for individual patients.

Background: The epidermal growth factor receptor 1 (EGFR1) plays a significant
role in cell proliferation and development. Its regulation in humans is very
critical and incompletely understood in Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Methods: 100 newly diagnosed NSCLC (lung adenocarcinoma) patients and 100 healthy
controls were included and allele specific (AS) polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
was used to genotype and expression was analyzed by quantitative real time PCR.
Overall survival of patients was analyzed by Kaplan-Meier method and for
prognostic significance ROC curve was plotted. Results: A statistically
significant difference (p<0.0001) in CC, AA and CA genotypes distribution among
patients and healthy controls was observed. Compared to the CC genotype as
reference, OR was 30.40 (95%CI 1.75- 524.9, p=0.0002) and 3.97 (95%CI 1.49-10.52,
p=0.003) for the homozygous AA and heterozygous CA genotypes respectively.
Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was also performed to analyze the relationship of 
EGFR1 (-191C/A) genotypes with progression free median survival of NSCLC patients
and the difference was found to be significantly (p=0.0002) associated with
different genotypes. In the ROC curve with respect to TNM stage at optimal
cut-off value of 9.88 fold increase in EGFR1 mRNA expression, sensitivity and
specificity were 92.9%, 83.3% respectively (AUC=0.95, p<0.0001). ROC curve w.r.t.
distant metastases at optimal cut-off value of 13.5 fold change EGFR1 mRNA
expression, sensitivity and specificity were 68.2%, 71.4% respectively (AUC=0.81,
p<0.0001). In ROC curve w.r.t to presence/ absence of pleural effusion at optimal
cut-off value of 14.8 fold change EGFR1 mRNA expression sensitivity and
specificity were 66.7%, 68.2% respectively (AUC=0.71, p=0.009). Conclusions:
Study concluded EGFR1 promoter polymorphism could be a risk factor associated
with disease and may be used as prognostic marker for patients’ survival and
predictor for disease worseness.

Hes3 is a basic helix-loop-helix factor gene, which was found to be involved in
neural cell differentiation. Expression and clinicopathological significance of
Hes3 in non-small cell lung cancer was not clear. In this study, we used
immunohistochemistry to examine Hes3 expression in normal human lung and
non-small cell lung cancer tissues. Hes3 expression was detected in cytoplasm and
nucleus. Hes3 expression in bronchial epithelial cells and epithelial cells of
submucosal glands was relatively weak and the positive rate was of 30.3% (10/33).
Hes3 expression in non-small cell lung cancer tissues (51.8% (58/112)) was
significantly higher than that in normal lung tissues (p < 0.05). Hes3 expression
in cancer tissues was significantly associated with poor differentiation,
advanced TNM stages, lymph node metastasis, and a shorter patient survival time
(p < 0.05). In vitro study showed that overexpression of Hes3 in A549 cells
significantly promoted cancer cell proliferation and invasion, while inhibition
of Hes3 expression significantly downregulated cancer cell proliferation and
invasion (p < 0.05). Western blotting showed that overexpression of Hes3
significantly upregulated expression of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7 in A549
cells, while inhibition of Hes3 expression in LK2 cells significantly
downregulated the expression of these molecules (p < 0.05). These results
indicated that Hes3 may contribute to the malignant phenotype of non-small cell
lung cancer, possibly through regulation of Cyclin D1, Cyclin D3, and MMP7, and
may be a promising cancer marker.

Comparatively less toxic and more tolerated, epidermal growth factor
receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitors (EGFR-TKIs) are recommendable for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients with EGFR-sensitive mutations. Some
EGFR wild-type patients with specific biomarkers also show a response to the
drug. TAZ is an oncogene closely associated with the therapeutic effect of
EGFR-TKIs. However, this association remains to be clarified. This study aimed to
clarify the mechanism through which TAZ sensitizes EGFR wild-type NSCLC to
gefitinib. We used CCK-8 assays and in vivo experiments to investigate the
influence of TAZ on gefitinib in EGFR wild-type NSCLC. To further validate the
tumorigenic role of TAZ, we performed Human umbilical vein endothelial cell
(HUVEC) tube formation and migration assays. Luciferase reporter assays,
quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR), immunoblotting and Chromatin
immunoprecipitation collaborated with qPCR illuminated the mechanism through
which TAZ caused those phenotypes. The results showed TAZ promoted the
angiogenesis of NSCLC cell lines and improved gefitinib sensitivity in EGFR
wild-type NSCLC in vitro and in vivo. Luciferase reporter assays and ChIP-qPCR
experiments showed TAZ upregulated AREG by promoting its transcription. EGFR
signaling pathway was activated as TAZ was highly expressed. Rescue experiments
were conducted to confirm the indispensable role of AREG in tumorigenesis and
gefitinib sensitivity regulated by TAZ. Our study concluded that TAZ sensitized
EGFR wild-type NSCLC to gefitinib through promoting amphiregulin transcription.

BACKGROUND: Stathmin-1regulates microtubule dynamics and is associated with
malignant phenotypes in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study evaluated 
its diagnostic value for differentiating between NSCLC and high-grade
neuroendocrine tumor (HGNET).
METHODS: Stathmin-1 protein expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry (IHC)
in surgical specimens of 414 NSCLC (305 adenocarcinoma [AD], 102 squamous cell
carcinoma [SCC], 7 large-cell carcinoma [LA]), 5 typical carcinoid (TC; a
low-grade neuroendocrine tumor), and 34 HGNET (17 small-cell carcinoma [SCLC] and
17 large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma [LCNEC]) and biopsy specimens of 57 NSCLCs
(29 AD and 28 SCC) and 42 HGNETs (17 LCNEC and 25 SCLC). We also analyzed
stathmin-1 mRNA levels in 81 NSCLC and 26 HGNET using reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).
RESULTS: Among NSCLC samples, we saw high stathmin-1 protein expression in only 3
AD, 1 SCC and 1 LA surgical samples, all 5 of which showed neuroendocrine
characteristics in pathological re-review; and low or intermediate expression in 
all 5 TC surgical samples and all 57 NSCLC biopsy samples. In contrast, all HGNET
surgical (n=34) and biopsy (n=42) samples showed highstathmin-1 expression. In
RT-PCR, stathmin-1expression was significantly higher in HGNET tissues than in
NSCLC tissues (P<0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: Stathmin-1 expression can help in differentiating NSCLC from HGNET.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer (LC) is the leading cause of cancer-related death in
Eastern Asia. The prognosis of LC highly depends on tumor stages and early
detection could substantially reduce LC mortality. Accumulating evidence
suggested that circulating miRNAs in plasma or serum may have applications in
early LC detection. We thus conducted a systematic literature review on the
diagnostic value of miRNAs markers for LC in East Asian populations.
METHODS: PubMed and ISI Web of Knowledge were searched to retrieve relevant
articles published up to 17 September 2018. Information on study design,
population characteristics, investigated miRNAs and diagnostic accuracy
(including sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve (AUC)) were
independently extracted by two reviewers.
RESULTS: Overall, 46 studies that evaluated a total of 88 miRNA markers for LC
diagnosis in East Asian populations were identified. Sixteen of the 46 studies
have incorporated individual miRNA markers as panels (with 2⁻20 markers). Three
promising miRNA panels with ≥90% sensitivity and ≥90% specificity were
discovered, two of which were externally validated. Diagnostic performance of
circulating miRNAs in East Asian populations was comparable to previously
summarized performance in Western populations. Forty-four miRNAs were reported in
both populations. No major differences in diagnostic performance by ethnicity of 
the same miRNA was observed.
CONCLUSIONS: Circulating miRNAs or miRNA panels, possibly in combination with
other promising molecular markers including epigenetic and genetic markers, may
be promising candidates for noninvasive LC early detection. However, large
studies with samples collected prospectively in true screening settings are
required to validate the promising markers or marker panels.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is one of the major causes of carcinoma-related deaths in
the world. Importantly, lung adenocarcinoma (LAC) is the most common type with
poor outcome. However, the progressive clinical phenotype and biomolecular
signature of lung cancer presenting the cancer stem-like and metastatic
characteristics are still unclear.
METHODS: In this study, we identified CD44 marker in lung cancers. The
capabilities, including tumorigenic and migration assays, were analyzed in CD44
expression and CD44 expression subgroups. Meanwhile, the potential bio-signature 
and properties of lung tumor stem-like cells were further studied.
RESULTS: The high expression of CD44 subpopulation (CD44-positive) in isolated
lung cancer cells showed significantly higher abilities of tumorigenic colonies, 
tumor-sphere formation, and migratory properties when compared with the CD44
expression group. These subgroups of CD44-positive lung cancer cells further
demonstrated the metastatic potential with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT), as well as the high expression of Twist and Snail gene profile.
Importantly, the overexpression of Snail with gene vector in CD44 expression
cells further significantly promoted the properties of lung tumor stem-like
cells.
CONCLUSION: The results of this study highlighted the role of CD44-posivite
subpopulation in modulating tumor initiation and EMT-based metastatic ability of 
lung malignancy.

High mortality rates caused by NSCLC show the need for the identification of
novel therapeutic targets. In this study we have investigated the biological
effects and molecular mechanisms elicited by TMPRSS4 in NSCLC. Overexpression of 
TMPRSS4 in LKR13 cells increased malignancy, subcutaneous tumor growth and
multiorganic metastasis. In conditional knock-down (KD) experiments, abrogation
of TMPRSS4 in H358 and H2170 cells altered proliferation, clonogenicity, tumor
engraftment and tumor growth. Reduction in S and G2/M phases of the cell cycle,
decreased BrdU incorporation and increased apoptosis was also found.
Transcriptomic analysis in KD cells revealed downregulation of genes involved in 
DNA replication, such as MCM6, TYMS and CDKN1A (p21). In patients, expression of 
a signature of MCM6/TYMS/TMPRSS4 genes was highly associated with poor prognosis.
Downregulation of TMPRSS4 significantly increased sensitivity to chemotherapy
agents. In experiments using cisplatin, apoptosis and expression of the
DNA-damage marker γ-H2A was higher in cells lacking TMPRSS4. Moreover, in vivo
assays demonstrated that tumors with no TMPRSS4 were significantly more sensitive
to cisplatin than controls. These results show that TMPRSS4 can be considered as 
a novel target in NSCLC, whose inhibition increases chemosensitivity.

CA199 is a sialic acid containing glycan antigen found in both glycoproteins and 
glycolipids, which is recognized by monoclonal antibodies generated by hybridoma 
technology. The increased serum CA199 levels measured by using the monoclonal
antibodies have been used as diagnostic or prognostic biomarker for pancreatic
cancer. Even though increased serum CA199 levels are also observed in other
cancers and noncancer diseases, it is largely unknown if CA199 levels could serve
as biomarkers for other diseases as well. Therefore, in our current study, serum 
CA199 levels from 45,645 patients with 47 clinically defined diseases and 14,783 
healthy controls who attended their annual physical examination were collected
and measured by the clinical laboratory in the Affiliated Hospital of Qingdao
University over the past 5 years. Based on the median, mean, and -Log10p values, 
we found that patients with pancreatic cancer, lung fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver
cancer, hepatitis, and pancreatitis had the highest media and mean serum CA199
levels with statistical significance based on the -Log10p values. Unexpectedly,
patients suffering from gout and anemia had significantly low CA199 levels
compared to that of the healthy controls. These results showed that serum CA199
levels are not only increased in pancreatic and other cancer patients but also
either increased or decreased in noncancer diseases. The overall data indicated
that the abnormal serum CA199 level might be an indicator of system malfunction
rather than a cancer biomarker in general.

Most of clinically used cancer biomarkers are either specific glycan structures
or glycoproteins. Although the high serum levels of the cancer biomarkers are
also present in certain patients suffering noncancer diseases, systematic
measurement and comparison of the serum levels of all cancer biomarkers among
cancer and noncancer patients have not been reported. In this study, the serum
levels of 17 glucose and glycan-related biomarkers including 10 cancer biomarkers
SCCA, CA724, CA50, CA242, CA125, CA199, CA153, AFP, CEA, and PSA were
retrospectively investigated based on clinical laboratory data in two medical
centers during the past 6 years (2012-2018). The data included a total of
1,477,309 clinical lab test results of 17 biomarkers from healthy controls and
patients suffering 64 different types of cancer and noncancer diseases. We found 
that the median serum levels of CA724, CEA, CA153, SCCA, and CA125 were highest
not in cancer patients but in patients suffering gout, lung fibrosis, nephrotic
syndrome, uremia, and cirrhosis, respectively. Consistently, the classical
ovarian cancer biomarker CA125 had better overall sensitivity and specificity as 
biomarker for cirrhosis (67% and 92%, respectively) than that for ovarian cancer 
(41% and 97%, respectively). Furthermore, the information shown as heatmap or
waterfall built on the -Log10p values of the 17 glycan-related biomarkers in
different clinically defined diseases suggested that all glycan-related
biomarkers had cancer-, aging-, and disease-relevant characteristics and cancers 
were systems disease. The detailed presentation of the data for each of the 17
biomarkers will be deliberated in chapters 6-23 in this book series.

Wide use of titanium dioxide nanoparticles (TiO2 NPs) as white pigments induces
unintentionally release in environment which increases concerns about their
adverse health effects on respiratory system. So it is crucial to get a deep
understanding of the disease process and molecular mechanism. Epigenetic
mechanisms, such as DNA methylation, have been found to play a role in the
development of lung diseases by affecting expression of key genes. In addition,
there could be potential different toxic effects of TiO2 NPs between young and
adult. Thus, the comparative toxicity of TiO2 NPs in 5-week (young) and 10-week
(adult) old NIH mice is investigated in this study following nasal inhalation of 
TiO2 NPs at dose of 20 mg/kg (body weight)/day for 30 days. Global DNA
methylation and hydroxymethylation in lung were measured. Promoter methylation of
inflammatory genes (IFN-γ and TNF-α) and tissue fibrosis gene (Thy-1) were
determined. Additional, RNA-sequencing runs were performed on the pulmonic
libraries. We found the induced pulmonary inflammation and fibrosis were more
severe in young mice. Decreased global methylation and hydroxymethylation were
only found in the young group. The altered methylation in promoter of TNF-α and
Thy-1 were found to play a role in the inflammatory response and fibration.
RNA-sequencing showed that in pathways in cancer expression of 197 genes was
up-regulated in the young mice more that in the adult mice. All these results
suggested that the young ages are more sensitive to TiO2 NP exposure and the
potential of abnormal DNA methylation might be used as biomarkers of both
exposure and disease development.

Glutathione peroxidase 3 (GPx3), a major antioxidant enzyme in plasma, catalyzes 
the reduction of H2O2, lipid peroxides and organic hydroperoxides by reducing
glutathione (GSH). Hypermethylation of the GPx3 promoter and suppression of GPx3 
expression are associated with inflammation, tumorigenesis, and response to
chemotherapy in various types of cancer. We previously reported the possibility
of GPx3 as a serological marker for lung cancer. In this study, we assessed the
role of the microRNA (miRNA) hsa-miR-921 (miR-921) in the regulation of GPx3
expression in A549 lung cancer cells. The expression patterns of the miRNAs of
A549, H1650, and H1975 cells were compared and analyzed. Of 25 miRNAs from the
A549 cell line, the expression of 10 decreased and the expression of 15 increased
in comparison to the miRNAs from the other cell lines. Of the miRNAs with reduced
expression, the most reduced miRNA was miR-921 and the expected binding site of
which is in the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of GPx3. We found that miR-921
inhibited the expression of GPx3 and bound directly to the 3'-UTR of GPx3.

An increasing number of microRNA (miRNA) have been demonstrated to serve as
molecular biomarkers for tumor cell progression. miR‑512‑5p was revealed as
oncogenic regulator in several types of cancer. However, whether and how
miR‑512‑5p regulates non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains unclear. In the
present study, the expression of miR‑512‑5p was detected in NSCLC tissues and
cell lines. Then, the proliferation, migration, invasion and apoptosis in NSCLC
A549 and H1299 cell lines were detected when miR‑512‑5p was overexpressed.
Furthermore, the underlying mechanism was identified. The level of miR‑512‑5p was
decreased in NSCLC tissues and in NSCLC cells compared with adjacent normal
tissues and normal lung tissue cell lines. miR‑512‑5p mimics inhibited the cell
proliferation, migration, invasion and induced apoptosis in A549 and H1299 cells.
In addition, a luciferase reporter assay suggested that overexpression of
miR‑512‑5p may decrease the expression of the E26 transformation
specific‑1 (ETS1) gene; it was subsequently verified that downregulation of the
ETS1 gene inhibited cell proliferation and migration and induced cell apoptosis
in A549 and H1299 cells, and ETS1 small interfering RNA in the presence of an
miR‑512‑5p inhibitor reversed the effect. The data described in the present study
suggest that miR‑512‑5p may be a tumor suppressor and a potential treatment
target in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) have become a potential diagnostic
tumor marker and have the potential for wide clinical applications. However, the 
diagnostic parameters vary among previous studies. A systematic review of the
literature and meta-analysis were conducted to assess the diagnostic value of
CTCs for lung cancer.
METHODS: Eligible studies were searched in PubMed, Medline, Cochrane Library, and
Embase databases. The included studies assessed the diagnostic value of CTCs in
patients with lung cancer up to September 30, 2018. A total of 1601 patients in 8
studies were included in the meta-analysis. We calculated the pooled sensitivity,
specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR),
diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) to investigate the
diagnostic value of CTCs for lung cancer. STATA version 12.0 and Meta-DiSc
version 1.4 software were used to analyze the data.
RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity was 0.75 (95% CI: 0.73-0.78), the specificity was
0.89 (95% CI: 0.86-0.92), the PLR was 6.29 (95% CI: 3.98-9.96), and the NLR was
0.24 (95% CI: 0.14-0.42). Furthermore, the pooled DOR of CTCs for lung cancer was
27.73 (95% CI: 12.99-59.23). The summarized area under the ROC curve was 0.93
(95% CI: 0.90-0.95). The meta-regression analysis suggested that the
heterogeneity was mainly attributed to the experimental methods. The results of
the clinical diagnosis efficiency show that the diagnostic efficiency has
increased significantly by testing CTCs for diagnosing lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: The results of this meta-analysis suggest that CTCs are associated
with a high diagnostic value for lung cancer. These findings require large-scale 
prospective studies to verify and evaluate the diagnostic value in the future.

OBJECTIVES: Kita-Kyushu lung cancer antigen-1 (KK-LC-1) is a cancer/testis
antigen reactivated in several human malignancies. So far, the major focus of
studies on KK-LC-1 has been on its potential as diagnostic biomarker and
immunotherapy target. However, its biological functions and molecular mechanisms 
in cancer progression remain unknown.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Expression of KK-LC-1 in HCC was analysed using RT-qPCR,
Western blot and immunohistochemistry. The roles of KK-LC-1 on HCC progression
were examined by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Pathway
inhibitor DAPT was employed to confirm the regulatory effect of KK-LC-1 on the
downstream Notch signalling. The interaction of KK-LC-1 with presenilin-1 was
determined by co-immunoprecipitation. The association of CpG island methylation
status with KK-LC-1 reactivation was evaluated by methylation-specific PCR,
bisulphite sequencing PCR and 5-Aza-dC treatment.
RESULTS: We identified that HCC tissues exhibited increased levels of KK-LC-1.
High KK-LC-1 level independently predicted poor survival outcome. KK-LC-1
promoted cell growth, migration, invasion and epithelial-mesenchymal transition
in vitro and in vivo. KK-LC-1 modulated the Notch1/Hes1 pathway to exacerbate HCC
progression through physically interacting with presenilin-1. Upregulation of
KK-LC-1 in HCC was attributed to hypomethylated CpG islands.
CONCLUSIONS: This study identified that hypomethylation-induced KK-LC-1
overexpression played an important role in HCC progression and independently
predicted poor survival. We defined the KK-LC-1/presenilin-1/Notch1/Hes1 as a
novel signalling pathway that was involved in the growth and metastasis of HCC.

INTRODUCTION: Immunotherapy is regarded one of the major breakthroughs in cancer 
treatment. Despite its success, only a subset of patients responds - urging the
quest for predictive biomarkers. We hypothesize that Artificial Intelligence (AI)
algorithms can automatically quantify radiographic characteristics that are
related to and may therefore act as non-invasive radiomic biomarkers for
immunotherapy response.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: In this study, we analyzed 1055 primary and metastatic
lesions from 203 patients with advanced melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) undergoing anti-PD1 therapy. We performed a AI-based characterization of 
each lesion on the pretreatment contrast-enhanced CT imaging data to develop and 
validate a non-invasive machine learning biomarker capable of distinguishing
between immunotherapy responding and non-responding. To define the biological
basis of the radiographic biomarker, we performed gene-set enrichment analysis in
an independent dataset of 262 NSCLC patients.
RESULTS: The biomarker reached significant performance on NSCLC lesions (up to
0.83 AUC, p < 0.001) and borderline significant for melanoma lymph nodes (0.64
AUC, p = 0.05). Combining these lesion-wide predictions on a patient level,
immunotherapy response could be predicted with an AUC of up to 0.76 for both
cancer types (p < 0.001), resulting in a one year survival difference of 24%
(p = 0.02). We found highly significant associations with pathways involved in
mitosis, indicating a relationship between increased proliferative potential and 
preferential response to immunotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that radiographic characteristics of lesions 
on standard-of-care imaging may function as non-invasive biomarkers for response 
to immunotherapy, and may show utility for improved patient stratification in
both neoadjuvant and palliative settings.

BACKGROUND: Identifying genetic variants with pleiotropic associations across
multiple cancers can reveal shared biologic pathways. Prior pleiotropic studies
have primarily focused on European-descent individuals. Yet population-specific
genetic variation can occur, and potential pleiotropic associations among diverse
racial/ethnic populations could be missed. We examined cross-cancer pleiotropic
associations with lung cancer risk in African Americans.
METHODS: We conducted a pleiotropic analysis among 1,410 African American lung
cancer cases and 2,843 controls. We examined 36,958 variants previously
associated (or in linkage disequilibrium) with cancer in prior genome-wide
association studies. Logistic regression analyses were conducted, adjusting for
age, sex, global ancestry, study site, and smoking status.
RESULTS: We identified three novel genomic regions significantly associated
(FDR-corrected P <0.10) with lung cancer risk (rs336958 on 5q14.3, rs7186207 on
16q22.2, and rs11658063 on 17q12). On chromosome16q22.2, rs7186207 was
significantly associated with reduced risk [OR = 0.43; 95% confidence interval
(CI), 0.73-0.89], and functional annotation using GTEx showed rs7186207 modifies 
DHODH gene expression. The minor allele at rs336958 on 5q14.3 was associated with
increased lung cancer risk (OR = 1.47; 95% CI, 1.22-1.78), whereas the minor
allele at rs11658063 on 17q12 was associated with reduced risk (OR = 0.80; 95%
CI, 0.72-0.90).
CONCLUSIONS: We identified novel associations on chromosomes 5q14.3, 16q22.2, and
17q12, which contain HNF1B, DHODH, and HAPLN1 genes, respectively. SNPs within
these regions have been previously associated with multiple cancers. This is the 
first study to examine cross-cancer pleiotropic associations for lung cancer in
African Americans.
IMPACT: Our findings demonstrate novel cross-cancer pleiotropic associations with
lung cancer risk in African Americans.

The incidence of nonsmoking female patients with non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) has increased in recent decades; however, the pathogenesis of patients is
unclear, and early diagnosis biomarkers are in urgent need. In this study, 136
nonsmoking female subjects (65 patients with NSCLC, 6 patients with benign lung
tumors, and 65 healthy controls) were enrolled, and their metabolic profiling was
investigated by using pseudotargeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. A
total of 56 annotated metabolites were found and verified to be significantly
different in nonsmoking females with NSCLC compared with the control. The
metabolic profiling was featured by disturbed energy metabolism, amino acid
metabolism, oxidative stress, lipid metabolism, and so on. Cysteine, serine, and 
1-monooleoylglycerol were defined as the biomarker panel for the diagnosis of
NSCLC patients. 98.5 and 91.4% of subjects were correctly distinguished in the
discovery and validation sets, respectively. The biomarker panel was also useful 
for the diagnosis of in situ malignancy patients, with an accuracy of 97.7 and
97.8% in the discovery and validation sets, respectively. The study provides a
biomarker panel for the auxiliary diagnosis of nonsmoking females with NSCLC.

OBJECTIVE: To explore the expression patterns of transcription factor SOX12 in
lung adenocarcinoma and its significance in the diagnosis and prognosis of the
malignancy.
METHODS: Large cancer genome databases were used to analyze SOX12 expression
level in lung adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) and semiquantitative PCR
were used to detect the expression of SOX12 in 36 specimens of lung
adenocarcinoma tissues, 15 adjacent tissues and 21 normal lung tissues. The
prognostic value of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma and lung squamous cell carcinoma
were analyzed using Kaplan-Meier Plotter database, and the relationship between
SOX12 expression and the overall survival (OS) and progression free survival
(PPS) of the patients were analyzed.
RESULTS: Analysis of TCGA database and GEO (GSE40419) database showed that SOX12 
expression levels were significantly higher in in lung adenocarcinoma than in
normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). The results of IHC and semiquantitative PCR
revealed that SOX12 was expressed at significantly higher levels in lung
adenocarcinoma than in normal lung tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis showed that patients with lung adenocarcinoma positive for SOX12 had a
significantly shorter OS and PPS time than those negative for SOX12 (P &lt;
0.05), but SOX12 positivity did not significantly affect OS and PPS of patients
with lung squamous cell carcinoma.
CONCLUSIONS: High expression levels of SOX12 in lung adenocarcinoma are
significantly associated with a poor OS of the patients, suggesting the value of 
SOX12 to assist in early diagnosis and prognostic evaluation of lung
adenocarcinoma.

OBJECTIVES: In non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC), tumour biopsy can often be an
invasive procedure. The development of a non-invasive methodology to study
genetic changes via circulating tumour cells (CTCs) is an appealing concept.
Whilst CTCs typically remain as rare cells, improvements in epitope-independent
CTC isolation techniques has given rise to a greater capture of CTCs. In this
cross sectional study, we demonstrate the capture and characterization of NSCLC
CTCs for the clinically actionable markers epidermal growth factor receptor
(EGFR) alterations, anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) rearrangements and
programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression. The study identified CTCs/CTC
clusters in 26/35 Stage IV NSCLC patients, and subsequently characterized the
CTCs for EGFR mutation, ALK status and PD-L1 status. This pilot study
demonstrates the potential of a non-invasive fluid biopsy to determine clinically
relevant biomarkers in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are capable of degrading and
modifying most components of the extracellular matrix (ECM) and the basal
membrane (BM), and play crucial roles in cancer invasion and metastasis. MMP gene
expressions were regulated primarily at the transcriptional level, which was
associated with tumor spread and patient prognosis. Polymorphisms in MMPs have
been reported to be associated with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The
objective of this study aim to evaluate the serum levels and polymorphisms of
MMP-9 and MMP-13 in non-small cell lung cancer patients compared to normal
subjects and their correlation to non-small cell lung cancer histopathology
findings in Southern Chinese people.
METHODS: This case⁻control study included 245 patients with NSCLC and 258 healthy
controls. Genomic DNA was extracted by using DNA extraction kit, genotyping was
confirmed by polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism
(PCR-RFLP) and direct DNA sequencing, and serum levels of MMP-9 and MMP-13 were
measured by using a specific ELISA, Human Matrix Metalloproteinase Enzyme
Immunoassay Kits. Statistical analysis was carried out using the SPSS 23.0
software package.
RESULTS: The subjects carrying the TT genotype had a decreased risk of lung
cancer in MMP9-1562C/T comparing with the CC genotype (p = 0.00, OR = 0.45, 95%
CI = 0.29⁻0.68), and the MMP13-77 AA genotype was associated with a decreased
risk of NSCLC by comparing with the GG genotype (p = 0.03, OR = 0.56, 95% CI =
0.33⁻0.94). Moreover, the C allele of MMP9-1562C/T could increase serum level of 
NSCLC in compared with the A allele (OR = 1.19, 95% CI = 0.75⁻1.89). Similarly,
the AA genotype of MMP13 might be a marker of decreased serum level of lung
cancer (OR = 0.76, 95% CI = 0.51⁻1.14).
CONCLUSIONS: The results of these analyses underline the support of the notion
that the CC genotype of MMP9-1562C/T and GG genotypes of MMP13-77G/A were
associated with the increased risk NSCLC, and the serum levels of MMP9 and MMP13 
were consistent with the results of the SNP analysis. MMP13 and MMP9 might be
function as a key oncogene in NSCLC with a Southern Chinese population. Combined 
detection of SNP and enzyme activity between MMP9 and MMP13 are expected to be a 
potential diagnostic method of non-small cell lung cancer.

BACKGROUND: It remains unclear why radiation clinically provides a synergistic
effect when combined with immune checkpoint inhibitors such as nivolumab. The
purpose of our study was to retrospectively evaluate whether the therapeutic
efficacy of nivolumab is improved as a result of a history of radiotherapy (RT)
in patients with previously treated advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: From February 2016 to December 2017, 124 consecutive patients were
administered nivolumab for pretreated advanced NSCLC. The patients were divided
into RT and non-RT groups.
RESULTS: Sixty-six (53%) of the 124 patients had been administered RT before the 
initiation of nivolumab, 52 (42%) received extracranial RT, and 40 (32%) were
treated with thoracic RT. The median number of nivolumab cycles was 4 (range:
1-43). The overall response rate (ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) of
nivolumab in all patients were 28.0% and 58.4%, respectively. The ORR (36.4%) was
significantly higher in patients who had received previous RT than in patients
who had not received any RT (19%). The therapeutic efficacy of nivolumab was
particularly noteworthy in patients with non-adenocarcinoma and squamous cell
carcinoma histology administered extracranial RT, with ORRs of 48.3% and 52.6%,
and DCRs of 87.1% and 84.2%, respectively.
CONCLUSION: Previous RT was an independent prognostic marker of favorable
prognosis after nivolumab administration and improved the response rate to
nivolumab treatment. Previous RT was clinically identified to have a synergistic 
effect with nivolumab treatment, increasing the response rate and improving the
outcome of patients with advanced NSCLC.

The respiratory epithelium arises from alveolar epithelial progenitors which
differentiate into alveolar epithelial type 1 (AT1) and type 2 (AT2) cells. AT2
cells are stem cells in the lung critical for the repair process after injury.
Mechanisms regulating AT1 and AT2 cell maturation are poorly defined. We report
that the activation of the glucocorticoid pathway in an in vitro alveolar
epithelial lineage differentiation assay led to increased AT2 marker Sftpc and
decreased miR-142 expression. Using miR-142 KO mice, we demonstrate an increase
in the AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Overexpression of miR-142 in alveolar
progenitor cells in vivo led to the opposite effect. Examination of the KO lungs 
at E18.5 revealed enhanced expression of miR-142 targets Apc, Ep300 and Kras
associated with increased β-catenin and p-Erk signaling. Silencing of miR-142
expression in lung explants grown in vitro triggers enhanced Sftpc expression as 
well as increased AT2/AT1 cell number ratio. Pharmacological inhibition of
Ep300-β-catenin but not Erk in vitro prevented the increase in Sftpc expression
triggered by loss of miR-142. These results suggest that the
glucocorticoid-miR-142-Ep300-β-catenin signaling axis controls pneumocyte
maturation.

INTRODUCTION: Epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathway deregulation
promotes the acquisition of stemlike properties in non-small-cell lung cancer.
EGFR inhibition through NOTCH enriches lung cancer stem cells (CSCs). Src through
Yes-associated protein 1 (YAP1) activates NOTCH. Signal transduction and
activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) activation occurs upon EGFR blockade and
regulates the generation of CSCs.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: Using the Aldefluor assay kit, we investigated the
enrichment of aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH)-positive cells in
EGFR-mutation-positive cells treated with gefitinib, afatinib, and osimertinib.
Western blot analysis was performed to evaluate changes in CSC marker expression 
upon EGFR blockade. We performed gene expression analysis in a cohort of
EGFR-mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer patients. We evaluated the
association of gene expression with treatment outcomes.
RESULTS: The cell subpopulation surviving EGFR inhibition had high ALDH activity 
and elevated CSC marker expression. Concurrent inhibition of EGFR, STAT3, and Src
diminished the CSC subpopulation in an EGFR-mutation-positive cellular model. In 
a cohort of 64 EGFR-mutation-positive patients, 2 ALDH1 isoforms and the NOTCH
target hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1), when highly expressed, were
predictive of worse outcome to EGFR blockade. The gene expression of
B-cell-specific Moloney murine leukemia virus integration site 1 (Bmi-1) that
maintains the self-renewal of stem cells was also related to treatment outcome.
CONCLUSION: Single EGFR inhibitors increase the population of CSCs. Combinatory
therapy targeting STAT3 and Src may be of potential benefit. ALDH1, HES1, and
Bmi-1 are essential biomarkers in the initial assessment of
EGFR-mutation-positive patients.

BACKGROUND: Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) developed during immunotherapy 
with anti-PD-1 agents, could be a predictive surrogate marker of clinical benefit
in patients with advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: Patients with NSCLC, treated with anti-PD-1 agents, were retrospectively
evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate the
relationships between types of irAEs (differentiated according to system/organ
involved and to single-site/multiple-site), overall response rate (ORR),
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). We further performed a
6-week landmark analysis.
RESULTS: A total of 559 patients were enrolled; 231 patients (41.3%) developed
irAEs of any grade and 50 patients (8.9%) G3/G4 events; 191 of them (82.6%)
developed "single-site" irAEs and 40 (17.4%) "multiple-site" irAEs. At
multivariate analysis, higher ORR was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), 
"single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine (P = .0043) and skin irAEs (P =
.0005). Longer PFS was related to irAEs of any grade (P < .0001), "single-site"
irAEs (P < .0001), "multiple-site" irAEs (P = .0374), endocrine irAEs (P = .0084)
and skin irAEs (P = .0001). Longer OS was related to irAEs of any grade (P <
.0001), "single-site" irAEs (P < .0001), endocrine irAEs (P = .0044),
gastrointestinal irAEs (P = .0437), skin irAEs (P = .0006), and others irAEs (P =
.0378). At the 6-week landmark analysis, irAEs of any grade was confirmed an
independent predictor of higher ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS.
CONCLUSION: Our study confirmed that irAEs are concordantly related to higher
ORR, longer PFS, and longer OS with anti-PD-1 immunotherapy in patients with
NSCLC.

INTRODUCTION: There is unmet need to explore the predictive biomarkers of
PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Here, 
we aimed to investigate the predictive and prognostic value of blood
neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) in NSCLC patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1
inhibitors.
METHODS: We performed a comprehensive online search to explore the association
between blood NLR and overall survival (OS) or progression-free survival (PFS) in
NSCLC patients received PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors. Published data including hazard
ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were eligible. Pooled estimates of 
treatment outcomes were calculated using Stata/MP 14.1.
RESULTS: 1700 patients from sixteen studies were included. The pooled results
suggested that high blood NLR was correlated with significantly shorter OS
(HR = 2.07, P < 0.001) and PFS (HR = 1.59, P < 0.001). The predictive and
prognostic significance of blood NLR were observed consistently across most
subgroups including publication year, study design, research region, PD-L1
expression detection, sample size, NLR cutoff, median follow-up time and study
quality score. Additionally, there was a significant correlation between elevated
NLR cutoff values and OS benefit (r = 0.585, P =  0.036) but not for PFS benefit 
(r = 0.198, P =  0.496). Notably, HRs of PFS showed significant correlation with 
HRs of OS (r = 0.686, P =  0.041).
CONCLUSION: Elevated blood NLR was associated with shorter PFS and OS in NSCLC
patients treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors, suggesting its potential predictive 
and prognostic value in this clinical scenario.

OBJECTIVES: A number of key immune regulators show prognostic value in malignant 
pleural mesothelioma (MPM), but the association between Bridging integrator 1
(BIN1), indoleamine 2,3 dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) and patient outcome has not been
investigated. We aimed to determine the expression of BIN1 and IDO1, their
association with other markers and impact on overall survival (OS) in MPM.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The expression of BIN1, IDO1, CD3, CD20 and CD68 were
evaluated by immunohistochemistry in 67 patients who underwent
pleurectomy/decortication. Survival analyses were performed using the Kaplan
Meier method and significant biomarkers were entered into a Cox Regression
multivariate model, accounting for known prognostic factors such as age, gender, 
histological subtype, PD-L1 expression and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio.
RESULTS: Immune markers were variably expressed in tumor cells, ranging from 0%
to 100% for BIN1 (median: 89%), and 0% to 77.5% for IDO1 (median: 0%). Expression
of markers of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and macrophages ranged from
0% to more than 50%. BIN1 expression was high in 35 patients (51%) and was
associated with increased OS (median: 12 vs 6 months for high and low BIN1
respectively,p = 0.03). Multivariate analysis showed BIN1 remained an independent
prognostic indicator (HR 0.39; 95% CI: 0.18-0.82, p = 0.01). The majority of
patients had immune inflamed tumors (77%) and there was a significant association
between TILs and BIN1 (p = 0 < 0.01), PD-L1 (p=0.04) and CD68+ macrophages in the
tumor (p < 0.01). There were no significant associations between PD-L1 and BIN1
or IDO1.
CONCLUSION: High BIN1 expression is a favorable prognostic biomarker and is
associated with TILs in MPM.

OBJECTIVES: The biomarkers cytokeratin 19 fragment (CYFRA 21-1) and human
epididymis protein 4 (HE4) are useful in the diagnosis, prognosis, and monitoring
of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), but their combination has not been
investigated yet. The objective of this analysis was to evaluate the ability of
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 to predict recurrence as part of follow-up monitoring in
patients with adenocarcinoma (ADC) of the lung.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Serum samples were collected from patients with stage
I-IIIA ADC preoperatively and during follow-up at 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months and
then every 6-12 months up to 5 years post-R0 resection. Samples were analyzed for
CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 via electrochemiluminescence immunoassay. All cases of disease
recurrence were verified by imaging. The diagnostic performance of CYFRA 21-1,
HE4, and their combination to predict recurrence was assessed by Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) and corresponding area under the curve (AUC).
RESULTS: 115 patients with ADC were included (N = 612 biomarker measurements);
median age was 63 years; most had stage I-II disease (n = 97; 84.3%). All
patients underwent surgical resection; 44 patients (38%) also received adjuvant
chemotherapy and 16 (14%) received radiation therapy. At the median timepoint for
the last blood sample collection (37 months), 31 patients (27%) had experienced
recurrence. Both CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 were able to detect recurrence (AUC and 95%
confidence interval [CI]): 75.9% (66.0-85.8%) and 75.4% (65.9-84.8%),
respectively, but this increased with the combination (78.8% [69.0-88.6%]). At a 
sensitivity of 80%, the respective specificities (95% CI) for CYFRA 21-1, HE4,
and the combination were 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), 57.1% (53.0-61.2%), and 69.7%
(65.8-73.4%).
CONCLUSION: Serial measurements of serum CYFRA 21-1 and HE4 levels could provide 
a valuable method for follow-up monitoring of patients with ADC to detect
recurrence.

BACKGROUND: Growing evidence indicates that inflammation contributes to cancer
progression, and several inflammatory markers have been reported to be associated
with the clinical outcomes in patients with various types of cancer. Recently,
the advanced lung cancer inflammation index (ALI) has been developed as a
prognostic marker in patients with lung cancer. The difference between the ALI
and the inflammatory markers reported in the previous studies is that the ALI
contains not only indices related to inflammation but also the body mass index
(BMI), which was reported to correlate with the sarcopenic status. The aim of
this study was to evaluate the prognostic significance of the ALI in patients
with unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer.
METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed a database of 159 patients who underwent
combination chemotherapy for unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer between
2008 and 2016. The BMI was calculated by dividing the weight by height squared.
The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) was calculated from a blood sample by
dividing the absolute neutrophil count by the absolute lymphocyte count. The ALI 
was defined as follows: ALI=BMI × serum albumin concentration/NLR.
RESULTS: The overall survival rate was significantly worse in the low-ALI group
than in the high-ALI group (p < 0.0001). Furthermore, the ALI was an independent 
prognostic factor for the overall survival (hazard ratio: 2.773, 95% confidence
interval: 1.773-4.335, p < 0.001).
CONCLUSIONS: A newly developed prognostic marker, the ALI, was found to be a
novel prognostic marker in patients with unresectable metastatic colorectal
cancer as well as in patients with lung cancer.

Background: Lung cancer is the most common and lethal malignancy worldwide. TCTP 
is highly expressed in various cancers including lung cancer.
Epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) could increase cancer cell invasion.
Whether TCTP's expression is associated with EMT in lung adenocarcinoma is
largely unknown.
Methods: Several Gene Expression Omnibus datasets were used to analyze the
correlation between TCTP expression and overall survival of lung adenocarcinoma
patients by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Then, 24 surgically removed fresh
lung adenocarcinoma tissue samples and paired paracancer tissue samples were used
to analyze the correlation between TCTP expression and tumor stage by
immunohistochemical analysis. Furthermore, stable cell lines were generated using
lentiviral transduction systems to knock down or overexpress TCTP in A549 cells. 
Cell migration and invasion were measured by scratch and transwell assays, and
EMT marker proteins such as α-SMA, ZEB1, and E-cadherin were quantitated by
Western blot. The expression levels of miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429 were
determined by real-time quantitative PCR, and their target genes were predicted
by an online database miRTarBase. The interaction between TCTP and these genes
was analyzed by String database and visualized by Cytoscape.
Results: TCTP was highly expressed in tumor tissues compared to paracancer
tissues. The expression of TCTP was associated with shorter overall survival.
TCTP knockdown experiment in A549 cells suggested that TCTP knockdown could
decrease the migration and invasion of lung cancer cells, and the expression
level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but increase the expression of E-cadherin and p53. Vice 
versa, overexpression of TCTP could increase the migration and invasion of cancer
cells, and the expression level of ZEB1 and α-SMA, but decrease the expression of
E-cadherin and p53. Furthermore, we found the expression of miR-200a, miR-141,
and miR-429 was associated with TCTP expression.
Conclusion: TCTP promotes EMT in lung adenocarcinoma, and this effect may be
associated with miR-200 family members like miR-200a, miR-141, and miR-429.

BACKGROUND: Pulmonary parenchymal destruction is consequence of Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), which results in degradation of the
extracellular matrix and the appearance of peripheral pulmonary cells. The aim of
this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the detection and isolation of
Circulating Pulmonary Cells (CPCs) in peripheral blood of patients with COPD.
METHODS: 17 COPD patients were enrolled in this prospective study to isolate
CPCs. Peripheral blood samples for CPC analysis were processed using positive
immunomagnetic methods combined with a double immunocytochemistry. Two
antibodies, anti-cytokeratin and anti-CD44v6 were used to confirm the epithelial 
nature of the isolated cells and their lung origin respectively.
RESULTS: CK/CD44v6 positive CPCs were identified in 6 of 17 COPD patients (35.2% 
of the total) (range: 1-2 cells). No CPCs were detected in any of the 10 healthy 
volunteers. The COPD CPCs + patients showed a trend towards greater severity of
the disease.
CONCLUSIONS: This study suggest the feasibility to detect CPCs in peripheral
blood of patients with COPD and its potential use as prognostic marker.

The antitumor activity of bromodomain and extra-terminal motif protein inhibitors
(BETi) has been demonstrated across numerous types of cancer. As such, these
inhibitors are currently undergoing widespread clinical evaluation. However,
predictive biomarkers allowing the stratification of tumors into responders and
non-responders to BETi are lacking. Here we showed significant anti-proliferative
effects of low dosage BETi in vitro and in vivo against aggressive ovarian and
lung cancer models lacking SMARCA4 and SMARCA2, key components of SWI/SNF
chromatin remodeling complexes. Restoration of SMARCA4 or SMARCA2 promoted
resistance to BETi in these models, and conversely, knockdown of SMARCA4
sensitized resistant cells to BETi. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that
exposure to BETi potently downregulated a network of genes involved in receptor
tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells, including the
oncogenic RTK HER3. Repression of signaling downstream of HER3 was found to be an
important determinant of response to BETi in SMARCA4/A2-deficient cells. Overall,
we propose that BETi represent a rational therapeutic strategy in poor prognosis,
SMARCA4/A2-deficient cancers.

INTRODUCTION: Cancer immunotherapy represents a major therapeutic breakthrough.
Immune checkpoint inhibitors alone or in the context of a combination are
considered the new standard of care in advanced non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). Areas covered: This review explains the biologic rationale behind the
implementation of immune checkpoint inhibitors for the therapy of advanced NSCLC.
It provides a detailed description of the clinical trials that have studied the
various agents now in use and the results that lead to the currently approved
indications. It also explores the area of established and developing biomarkers, 
and the trends of combining immunotherapy with other treatment modalities
(chemotherapy, antiangiogenic agents, radiotherapy), or with other immune
modulators. Expert opinion: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have been established as
the new standard of care for patients with advanced NSCLC. They can be
administered according to PD-L1 expression upfront as monotherapy or in
combination with chemotherapy- regardless of PD-L1 status - or in the later lines
of therapy. They also represent a less toxic and more effective treatment choice 
than chemotherapy alone. The development of reliable biomarkers for patient
selection and the subsequent use of the appropriate immune-based approach for
each patient will define the role of immunotherapy in the years to come.

BACKGROUND: We aimed to explore biological functions of differentially expressed 
miRNAs during carcinogenesis, to identify miRNAs dysegulations involved in DNA
repair mechanisms, and to evaluate potential of miRNAs as prognostic and
diagnostic biomarkers for early lung adenocarcinomas (LAC).
METHODS: We obtained 21 LAC and paired adjacent normal formalin-fixed,
paraffin-embedded lung tissues from patients who underwent curative resection for
stage I LAC. We compared expression levels of eight miRNAs involved in DNA repair
mechanism between LAC and adjacent tissues.
RESULTS: Expressions of Hsa-miR-9-5p, hsa-miR-24-3p, hsa-miR-125a-3p,
hsa-miR-125b-5p, hsa-miR-155-5p, and hsa-let-7a-5p were significantly
up-regulated in stage I LAC tissues compared with those in adjacent tissues. In
addition, expressions of hsa-mir-9-5p, hsa-mir-24-3p, hsa-mir-125a-3p,
hsa-mir-125b-5p, and hsa-mir-155-5p were significantly up-regulated in stage Ia
LAC tissues, whereas expressions of hsa-mir-125a-3p and hsa-mir-125b-5p were
significantly up-regulated in stage Ib LAC tissues. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that AUROC of hsa-mir-125b-5p was 0.875 (P
< 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Expression of hsa-mir-125b-5p could be used to distinguish LAC from
adjacent tissues. Our result suggests that hsa-mir125b-5p can be a prognostic and
diagnostic biomarker for LAC.

As a noninvasive blood testing, the detection of cell-free DNA (cfDNA)
methylation in plasma has raised an increasing interest due to diagnostic
applications. Although extensively used in cfDNA methylation analysis, bisulfite 
sequencing is less cost-effective. In this study, we investigated the cfDNA
methylation patterns in lung cancer patients by MeDIP-seq. Compared with the
healthy individuals, 330 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at gene
promoters were identified in lung cancer patients with 33 hypermethylated and 297
hypomethylated regions, respectively. Moreover, these hypermethylated genes were 
validated with the publicly available DNA methylation data, yielding a set of ten
significant differentially methylated genes in lung cancer, including B3GAT2,
BCAR1, HLF, HOPX, HOXD11, MIR1203, MYL9, SLC9A3R2, SYT5, and VTRNA1-3. Our study 
demonstrated MeDIP-seq could be effectively used for cfDNA methylation profiling 
and identified a set of potential biomarker genes with clinical application for
lung cancer.

Diagnostic value of microRNA (miR)-197 and miR-145 in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) and their relationship with the clinicopathological parameters of NSCLC
patients were investigated. Seventy-six patients with NSCLC admitted to Jimo
Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine from July 2016 to March 2018 were
enrolled in group A, while 60 healthy who received health examinations during the
same period were enrolled in group B. The relative expression levels of serum
miR-197 and miR-145 were detected by RT-qPCR. The relative expression of serum
miR-197 in group A was significantly higher than that in group B (P<0.001); the
relative expression of serum miR-145 in group A was significantly lower than that
in group B (P<0.001); serum miR-197 in group A showed association with the
clinical stage of NSCLC patients (P<0.001); serum miR-145 in group A was
associated with the clinical stage and pathological differentiation of patients
with NSCLC (P<0.001). The AUC of serum miR-197 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.864 (95% 
CI: 0.804-0.924), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 73.68% and a specificity of
85.00%; the AUC of serum miR-145 diagnosis of NSCLC was 0.879 (95% CI:
0.824-0.934), with a diagnostic sensitivity of 84.21% and a specificity of
71.67%; the AUC of the diagnosis of the combination of serum miR-197 and miR-145 
for NSCLC was 0.952 (95% CI: 0.919-0.984), with a diagnostic sensitivity of
92.10% and a specificity of 78.33%. miR-197 and miR-145 are potential new
biomarkers in the diagnosis of NSCLC due to their possible involvement in the
occurrence and development of NSCLC. With good sensitivity and specificity of
single miR-197 and single miR-145 for the diagnosis of NSCLC, the combined
detection of miR-197 and miR-145 can achieve a better sensitivity in the
diagnosis of NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has emerged as a potential
biomarker predicting response to anti-programmed cell death-1 protein receptor
(PD-1)/programmed cell death-1 protein ligand (PD-L1) therapy, but few studies
have explored using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) TMB in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC).
MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 136 patients with NSCLC with ctDNA testing were
retrospectively evaluated from a single institution, along with a validation
cohort from a second institution. ctDNA TMB was derived using the number of
detected mutations over the DNA sequencing length.
RESULTS: Higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with smoking history
(p < .05, chi-squared test). Among patients treated with immune checkpoint
inhibitors (n = 20), higher ctDNA TMB was significantly correlated with shorter
progressive free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS; 45 vs. 355 days; hazard
ratio [HR], 5.6; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.3-24.6; p < .01, and OS 106 days
vs. not reached; HR, 6.0; 95% CI, 1.3-27.1; p < .01, respectively). In a small
independent validation cohort (n = 12), there was a nonsignificant numerical
difference for higher ctDNA TMB predicting shorter OS but not PFS. ctDNA TMB was 
not correlated with RECIST tumor burden estimation in the subset of patients
treated with immune checkpoint blockade.
CONCLUSION: The findings indicate that higher ctDNA TMB, at the current
commercial sequencing length, reflects worse clinical outcomes.
IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Biomarkers to identify patients who will respond to
immune checkpoint blockade are critical. Tissue tumor mutational burden (TMB) has
emerged as a viable biomarker to predict response to anti-PD-1/PD-L1 therapy, but
few studies have explored the meaning and potential clinical significance of
noninvasive, blood-based TMB. Here, we investigated circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)
TMB and present data demonstrating that current ctDNA TMB may reflect tumor
burden and that ctDNA panels with a greater number of mutations may be necessary 
to more accurately reflect tissue TMB.

BACKGROUND: Metastasis is the main cause of lung cancer mortality. Bone
marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a component of the cancer
microenvironment and contribute to cancer progression. Intratumoral hypoxia
affects both cancer and stromal cells. Exosomes are recognized as mediators of
intercellular communication. Here, we aim to further elucidate the communication 
between BMSC-derived exosomes and cancer cells in the hypoxic niche.
METHODS: Exosomal miRNA profiling was performed using a microRNA array. Lung
cancer cells and an in vivo mouse syngeneic tumor model were used to evaluate the
effects of select exosomal microRNAs. Hypoxic BMSC-derived plasma exosomal miRNAs
were assessed for their capacity to discriminate between cancer patients and
non-cancerous controls and between cancer patients with or without metastasis.
RESULTS: We demonstrate that exosomes derived from hypoxic BMSCs are taken by
neighboring cancer cells and promote cancer cell invasion and EMT.
Exosome-mediated transfer of select microRNAs, including miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p 
and miR-5100, from BMSCs to epithelial cancer cells activates STAT3 signaling and
increases the expression of mesenchymal related molecules. The diagnostic
accuracy of individual microRNA showed that plasma exosomal miR-193a-3p can
discriminate cancer patients from non-cancerous controls. A panel of these three 
plasma exosomal microRNAs showed a better diagnostic accuracy to discriminate
lung cancer patients with or without metastasis than individual exosomal
microRNA.
CONCLUSIONS: Exosome-mediated transfer of miR-193a-3p, miR-210-3p and miR-5100,
could promote invasion of lung cancer cells by activating STAT3
signalling-induced EMT. These exosomal miRNAs may be promising noninvasive
biomarkers for cancer progression.

BACKGROUND: Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as the most frequent type of lung 
cancer is associated with extensive mortality. Researchers have studied the
suitability of several molecules as biomarkers for early detection of this
cancer. Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) as the main regulators of gene expression 
have also been assessed in this regard.
METHODS: In the present study, we compared expression level of Fas-antisense 1
(FAS-AS1), Growth Arrest Specific 5 (GAS5), PVT1, Nuclear Paraspeckle Assembly
Transcript 1 (NEAT1), HOXA transcript antisense RNA myeloid-specific 1
(HOTAIRM1), taurine upregulated gene 1 (TUG1) and TNFα and hnRNPL related
immunoregulatory LincRNA (THRIL) in 32 NSCLC samples and their corresponding
adjacent non-cancerous tissues (ANCTs).
RESULTS: NEAT1 has been significantly over-expressed in NSCLC tissues obtained
from male subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (Relative expression
(REx) = 3.022, P = 0.019) but not in female subjects (P = 0.975). FAS-AS1 was
significantly down-regulated in NSCLC tissues obtained from both males and
females subjects compared with the corresponding ANCTs (REx = - 4.12 and - 3.14, 
P = 0.015 and 0.033 respectively). TUG1, GAS5, THRIL and HOTAIRM1 were
significantly down-regulated in tumoral tissues obtained from male subjects
compared with the corresponding ANCTs.
CONCLUSIONS: The observed dysregulation of these lncRNAs in NSCLC tissues
compared with the corresponding ANCTs warrants future studies to confirm the
results of the current study in larger sample sizes to elaborate their role as
cancer biomarkers.

Lung adenocarcinoma (LA) is the most commonly occurring histological type of
non‑small cell lung cancer. Diagnosis and treatment of LA remain a major clinical
challenge. In the present study, to identify early LA biomarkers, extracellular
vesicles (EVs) were separated from the plasma samples from 153 patients with LA
and 75 healthy controls. microRNA (miRNA) expression profiling was performed at
the screening stage (5 patients with LA vs. 5 controls), followed by verification
at the validation stage (40 patients with LA vs. 20 controls) using reverse
transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT‑qPCR). The four
disordered miRNAs (miR‑505‑5p, miR‑486‑3p, miR‑486‑3p and miR‑382‑3p) identified 
in the plasma EVs were further evaluated at the testing stage (108 patients with 
LA vs. 50 controls) by RT‑qPCR. It was revealed that miR‑505‑5p was upregulated, 
whereas miR‑382‑3p was downregulated, in the EVs from patients with LA.
Furthermore, miR‑505‑5p was also upregulated in tumor tissues, compared with
adjacent non‑tumor control tissues. Subsequently, the direct targets of
miR‑505‑5p were predicted using bioinformatics analyses, and verified by
luciferase assay and immunoblotting. The present study determined that miR‑505‑5p
functions as an oncogene, promoting lung cancer cell proliferation and inhibiting
cancer cell apoptosis via the targeting of tumor protein P53‑regulated
apoptosis‑inducing protein 1 (TP53AIP1). Finally, it was confirmed that
miR‑505‑5p in plasma EVs could be delivered to lung cancer cells, inhibiting cell
apoptosis and promoting cell proliferation by targeting TP53AIP1. In conclusion, 
the present study indicated that miRNA‑505‑5p functions as an oncogene that may
be used as a novel biomarker for the diagnosis and treatment of LA.

Korea.

BACKGROUND: We determined the clinical characteristics and predictive factors of 
long-term response to pemetrexed maintenance therapy as first-line treatment for 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: A total of 950 advanced NSCLC patients received pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 ) 
plus cisplatin (60 mg/m2 ) (Pem-Cis) induction chemotherapy every three weeks as 
first-line treatment between January 2010 and August 2018. Patients who did not
show progression after four cycles of Pem-Cis and received at least one cycle of 
pemetrexed maintenance were recruited (n = 199).
RESULTS: Patients were divided into subgroups according to total cycles of
pemetrexed: ≤ 10 (F10, n = 134) and > 10 (M10, n = 65). The M10 group had a
higher proportion of patients with stage M1a (intrathoracic metastasis alone) and
exhibited lower levels of thymidylate synthase (TS) than the F10 group (median
H-score 10.0% vs. 60.0%; P = 0.031). Further subgrouping identified extreme
responders: ≤ 7 (F7, n = 101) and ≥ 20 (M20, n = 26) cycles. The M20 group showed
lower mean serum CEA levels before (17.5 vs. 147.0; P = 0.099) and after (6.9 vs.
53.2; P = 0.001) Pem-Cis treatment, and a higher incidence of normalization after
Pem-Cis (abnormal 41.7% vs. 68.5%; P = 0.015). M1a stage, normalization of CEA
levels after Pem-Cis, and lower TS H-score were predictors of progression-free
survival in patients administered pemetrexed maintenance.
CONCLUSION: M1a stage and lower TS expression were predictors of long-term
response to pemetrexed maintenance. CEA normalization after Pem-Cis could be an
additional surrogate marker of positive response to long-term treatment.

Novel molecular targets and promising targeted therapies have reshaped
diagnostics in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Despite
this progress, the implementation of molecular screening to identify predictive
biomarkers in Indian clinical and pathology settings has been challenging due to 
operational and logistical constraints. This consensus guideline brings together 
medical oncologists, molecular pathologists and pathologists from India to
provide a quick and competent reference for biomarker testing in NSCLC. The
guideline summarizes the importance of targetable mutations in NSCLC such as
epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), rearrangements in anaplastic lymphoma
kinase and receptor tyrosine kinase encoded by ROS-1 gene, overexpression of
programmed cell death ligand-1 and resistant EGFR mutations. It reaffirms
recommendations from international working groups, discusses vulnerable
pre-analytical procedures and provides a balanced review on the pros and cons of 
different diagnostic tests (immunohistochemistry, fluorescence in situ
hybridization, polymerase chain reaction-based testing and next-generation
sequencing). The document also provides an algorithm to aid diagnostic
decision-making and a checklist to assess the quality of testing laboratories
that will help the medical oncologists make an informed choice. Overall, these
recommendations are based on evidence and clinical experience and will aid
policymakers, oncologists, health care practitioners and pathologists who strive 
to implement molecular strategies and make informed decisions for improved care
in NSCLC in India.Funding: AstraZeneca Pharma India Limited.

Development of treatment options for Chinese patients with advanced squamous cell
lung cancer: focus on afatinib.

University, Shanghai 200030, China, shun_lu@hotmail.com.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in China, and approximately one 
third of these cancers are squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) of the lung. Ethnic
diversity and country-specific environmental factors can account for
interindividual variations in response to and tolerability of anticancer
therapies. Although several targeted therapies have recently been approved for
patients with relapsed/refractory SqCC of the lung, only afatinib, an
irreversible ErbB family blocker, has data of Chinese patients. In the Phase III 
LUX-Lung 8 trial, afatinib demonstrated a significant clinical benefit vs the
reversible first-generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib in both the 
overall population and the Chinese subset, with a manageable safety profile.
Emerging biomarker data from LUX-Lung 8 suggest that patients with ErbB
mutations, especially ErbB2, and those classified as "good" in the VeriStrat®
proteomic test, may benefit from afatinib treatment in particular, regardless of 
ethnicity, and may get a long-term response. In conclusion, afatinib is a valid
second-line option for Chinese patients with SqCC of the lung, and specific
biomarkers may help guide in treatment decision-making. Ongoing studies will
provide further guidance on afatinib's place in the treatment algorithm,
alongside the other novel targeted therapies.

To summarize the therapeutic effects of PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors on patients with
advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in a real-world setting, we attempted
to identify potential molecular biomarkers or clinical factors that reflected the
therapeutic effect. The medical records of patients with non-small cell lung
cancer who were treated with PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors were obtained from the
outpatient department or inpatient department of Peking Union Medical College
Hospital from August 1, 2015, to January 1, 2018. Our follow-up continued until
May 1,2018. We chose overall survival (OS) as the primary observation endpoint
and progression-free survival (PFS), objective response rate (ORR), disease
control rate (DCR), and safety as the secondary observation endpoints. Efficacy
was evaluated according to the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors
(RECIST) 1.1. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to generate survival curves, and
we compared the influence of different factors on PFS and OS by the log-rank
test. The median follow-up time was 11 months. At the end of the follow-up, 24
patients (61.5%) were still undergoing immunotherapy, and 7 patients (17.9%) had 
died. Twenty-six cases (66.7%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as first-line
treatment, and 7 cases (17.9%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as second-line
treatment. Only 6 cases (15.4%) employed PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitors as third-line
treatment. Therapeutic effect evaluation: Complete response (CR): 1 case (2.6%). 
Partial response (PR): 10 cases (25.6%). Stable disease (SD): 16 cases (41.0%).
Progressive disease (PD): 12 cases (30.8%). The ORR was 28.2%, and DCR was 69.2%.
The median PFS was 25.5 months (95% CI 6.8-44.1 months), which failed to reach
the median OS. PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for advanced
non-small cell lung cancer patients in a real-world setting than in clinical
trials; PD-1/PD-L1 inhibitor treatment is more effective for people who are over 
70 than for people who are under 70. Additionally, patients who are over 75 years
old have a higher response rate, suggesting that elderly patients may receive
more benefits from immunotherapy; Patients who have an epidermal growth factor
receptor (EGFR) mutation (+) may benefit from immunotherapy after treatment with 
a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI). It is essential to identify these potential
patients from the entire patient pool; PD-1 may have a certain curative effect on
brain metastases from NSCLC. Local radiotherapy may help to improve PD-1
intracranial efficacy.

Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1), a master regulator of mitosis and the DNA damage
response, is considered to be an intriguing target in the research field of
mitotic intervention. The observation that Plk1 is overexpressed in multiple
human malignancies, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), gave rise to
the development of several small-molecule inhibitors. Volasertib, presently the
most extensively studied Plk1 inhibitor, has been validated to efficiently reduce
tumor growth in preclinical settings. Unfortunately, only modest antitumor
activity against solid tumors was reported in clinical trials. This discrepancy
prompted research into the identification of predictive biomarkers. In this
study, we investigated the therapeutic effect of volasertib monotherapy (i.e.,
cytotoxicity, cell cycle distribution, apoptotic cell death, cellular senescence,
and migration) in a panel of NSCLC cell lines differing in p53 status under both 
normal and reduced oxygen tension (<0.1% O2 ). A strong growth inhibitory effect 
was observed in p53 wild-type cells (A549 and A549-NTC), with IC50 values
significantly lower than those in p53 knockdown/mutant cells (A549-920 and
NCI-H1975) (P < 0.001). While mitotic arrest was significantly greater in cells
with nonfunctional p53 (P < 0.005), apoptotic cell death (P < 0.026) and cellular
senescence (P < 0.021) were predominantly induced in p53 wild-type cells.
Overall, the therapeutic effect of volasertib was reduced under hypoxia
(P < 0.050). Remarkably, volasertib inhibited cell migration in all cell lines
tested (P < 0.040), with the exception of for the NCI-H1975 p53 mutant cell line.
In conclusion, our results show an important difference in the therapeutic effect
of Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC cells with versus without functional p53. Overall,
the p53 wild-type cell lines were more sensitive to volasertib treatment,
suggesting that p53 might be a predictive biomarker for Plk1 inhibition in NSCLC.
Moreover, our results pave the way for new combination strategies with Plk1
inhibitors to enhance antitumor activity.

BACKGROUND: A germline deletion in BIM (B cell lymphoma-2-like 11) gene has been 
shown to impair the apoptotic response to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)
tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) in vitro but its impact on response to
EGFR-TKIs in patients of nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC) remains controversial.
METHODS: Eligible literature were searched and screened. Objective response rate 
(ORR) and disease control rate (DCR) were extracted and aggregated with odds
ratio (OR). Hazard ratio (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were extracted and
aggregated based on random-effect model.
RESULTS: Fourteen studies including 2694 NSCLC patients were eligible.
Individuals harboring BIM deletion polymorphism had inferior ORR (OR = 0.49, 95% 
CI: 0.34-0.70, P < .001), inferior DCR (OR = 0.50, 95% CI: 0.30-0.84, P = .009). 
Patients with BIM deletion had shorter OS despite of the heterogeneity between
countries (in subgroup of South Korea and Taiwan, HR = 1.34, 95% CI: 1.18-1.53,
P < .001; in subgroup of other countries, HR = 2.43, 95% CI: 2.03-2.91,
P < .001). The pooled analysis of PFS showed great heterogeneity (I = 79%). All
the reported characteristics did not account for the heterogeneity. However, 2
subgroups could be obtained through sensitivity analysis. In one subgroup,
patients with BIM deletion polymorphism had shorter PFS (HR = 2.03, 95% CI:
1.71-2.40, P < .001), while in the other subgroup, no significant difference was 
observed (HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.79-1.06, P = .25).
CONCLUSION: NSCLC patients with BIM deletion polymorphism show poor ORR, DCR, and
OS after EGFR-TKIs treatment. BIM deletion polymorphism indicates poor response
to EGFR-TKIs, and it could be used as a predictor to identify those who would
benefit from EGFR-TKIs in NSCLC patients.

OBJECTIVE: The relationship between OCT4 and clinicopathological features in lung
cancer is controversial from the recently publications. Therefore, we conducted
this meta-analysis to quantitatively investigate the prognostic and
clinicopathologic characteristics of OCT4 in lung cancer.
METHODS: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
Library, WOS, CNKI and Wanfang databases was performed to identify studies.
Correlations between OCT4 expression and survival outcomes or clinicopathological
features were analyzed using meta-analysis methods.
RESULTS: Twenty-one studies with 2523 patients were included. High OCT4
expression has a poorer overall survival (OS) (univariate: HR= 2.00, 95% CI =
(1.68, 2.39), p<0.0001; multivariate: HR= 2.43, 95% CI = (1.67, 3.55), p<0.0001) 
and median overall survival (MSR = 0.51, 95% CI = (0.44, 0.58), p < 0.0001),
disease-free survival (DFS) (HR= 2.18, 95% CI = (1.30, 3.67), p = 0.003) and
poorer disease-specific survival (DSS) (HR= 2.23, 95% CI = (1.21, 4.11), p =
0.010). Furthermore, high OCT4 expression related with lower 5 year
disease-specific survival rate (OR= 0.24, 95% CI = (0.14, 0.41), p<0.0001) and 10
year overall survival rate (OR= 0.22, 95% CI = (0.12, 0.40), p=0.0001).
Additionally, OCT4-high expression was also strongly associated with higher
clinical TNM stage, lymph node metastasis, tumor distant metastasis, higher
histopathologic grade, but not related with gender, smoking status, tumor size
and histologic type of lung cancer.
CONCLUSION: OCT4 over-expression in lung cancer was strongly related poorer
clinicopathological features and worse survival outcomes, which suggests that
OCT4 could be a valuable prognostic marker in lung cancer.

The impact of the tumor immune microenvironment on overall survival in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has been studied, but there is little information on its
relevance for risk of relapse after surgery. Understanding more about the immune 
microenvironment in previously untreated NSCLC could help in identifying
high-risk patients and patients more likely to benefit from neoadjuvant/ adjuvant
immunotherapy. Here, we examined gene expression in 399 surgically-derived NSCLC 
samples and 47 samples from normal lung, using Agilent microarray and RNA
sequencing. In 335 of the tumor samples programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1)
expression was evaluated by immunohistochemistry. Gene expression was used to
estimate content of immune cells and to calculate an immune score. Properties of 
the immune microenvironment, and its impact on prognosis, were compared in
histological subgroups and gene expression subtypes. Tumors with an active immune
microenvironment were found for both adenocarcinomas (AD) and squamous cell
carcinomas (SCC). In AD, high immune score and high estimates of several immune
cell types belonging to the adaptive immune system were associated with better
progression free survival (PFS), while in SCC, no association between immune
characteristics and PFS was found. The immune microenvironment, including PD-L1
expression, and its impact on prognosis showed clear differences in AD and SCC
gene expression subtypes. In conclusion, the NSCLC immune microenvironment is
predictive of prognosis after surgery. Lung AD and SCC gene expression subtypes
should be investigated as potential prognostic biomarkers in patients treated
with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

We identified computational imaging features on 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron
emission tomography (PET) that predict recurrence/progression in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). We retrospectively identified 291 patients with NSCLC from 2
prospectively acquired cohorts (training, n = 145; validation, n = 146). We
contoured the metabolic tumor volume (MTV) on all pretreatment PET images and
added a 3-dimensional penumbra region that extended outward 1 cm from the tumor
surface. We generated 512 radiomics features, selected 435 features based on
robustness to contour variations, and then applied randomized sparse regression
(LASSO) to identify features that predicted time to recurrence in the training
cohort. We built Cox proportional hazards models in the training cohort and
independently evaluated the models in the validation cohort. Two features
including stage and a MTV plus penumbra texture feature were selected by LASSO.
Both features were significant univariate predictors, with stage being the best
predictor (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.15 [95% confidence interval (CI): 1.56-2.95], P 
< .001). However, adding the MTV plus penumbra texture feature to stage
significantly improved prediction (P = .006). This multivariate model was a
significant predictor of time to recurrence in the training cohort (concordance =
0.74 [95% CI: 0.66-0.81], P < .001) that was validated in a separate validation
cohort (concordance = 0.74 [95% CI: 0.67-0.81], P < .001). A combined radiomics
and clinical model improved NSCLC recurrence prediction. FDG PET radiomic
features may be useful biomarkers for lung cancer prognosis and add clinical
utility for risk stratification.

Long non-coding RNA (lncRNA)-NEF is a newly discovered lncRNA, which exhibits an 
inhibitory function on the metastasis of hepatocellular carcinoma, while its
involvement in other types of malignancy are unknown. In the present study, tumor
and adjacent healthy tissues were obtained from patients with non-small-cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), and blood was obtained from patients with NSCLC and healthy
individuals. Expression levels of lncRNA-NEF in tumor tissue samples, healthy
tissue samples and serum were detected by reverse transcription-quantitative
polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR). Receiver operating characteristic curve
analysis and survival curve analysis were performed to evaluate the diagnostic
and prognostic value of serum lncRNA-NEF for NSCLC. The effects of lncRNA-NEF
overexpression in NSCLC cell lines on tumor cell proliferation, glucose uptake,
glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) protein expression and mRNA expression were
investigated by Cell Counting kit-8 assay, glucose uptake assay, western blot
analysis and RT-qPCR, respectively. It was identified that lncRNA-NEF was
downregulated in NSCLC tissues, compared with healthy controls, and the serum
level of lncRNA-NEF was negatively associated with primary tumor stage.
Therefore, serum lncRNA-NEF may be a sensitive diagnostic and prognostic marker
for NSCLC. Overexpression of lncRNA-NEF inhibited NSCLC cell proliferation and
glucose uptake, and downregulated GLUT1 expression. Therefore, it can be
concluded that lncRNA-NEF can target glucose transportation to inhibit the
proliferation of NSCLC cells.

KRAS is the most frequent oncogene in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a
molecular subset characterized by historical disappointments in targeted
treatment approaches such as farnesyl transferase inhibition, downstream MEK
inhibition, and synthetic lethality screens. Unlike other important mutational
subtypes of NSCLC, preclinical work supports the hypothesis that KRAS mutations
may be vulnerable to immunotherapy approaches, an efficacy associated in
particular with TP53 co-mutation. In this review we detail reasons for previous
failures in KRAS-mutant NSCLC, evidence to suggest that KRAS mutation is a
genetic marker of benefit from immune checkpoint inhibition, and emerging direct 
inhibitors of K-Ras which will soon be combined with immunotherapy during
clinical development. With signs of real progress in this subgroup of unmet need,
we anticipate that KRAS mutant NSCLC will be the most important molecular subset 
of cancer to evaluate the combination of small molecules and immune checkpoint
inhibitors (CPI).

BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung
malignancies and its prognosis is dismal. Although early studies have shown
promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockers, the immune composition
and expression of potentially actionable immunostimulatory targets in this
malignancy are poorly understood.
METHODS: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the
levels of 3 different B7 family ligands PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and major tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue
microarray format. Associations between the marker levels, clinicopathological
variables and survival were studied.
RESULTS: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of 
SCLC cases. The markers showed limited co-expression and were not associated with
the level of TILs, age, gender and stage. Elevated B7-H4 was associated with
shorter 5-year overall survival. The levels of CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TILs and the 
ratio of total/effector T-cells were significantly lower in SCLC than in
non-small cell lung cancer. High levels of CD3+, but not CD8+ or CD20+ TILs were 
significantly associated with longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicate variable expression and clinical 
role of B7-family ligands in SCLC with predominant expression of the candidate
target B7-H3 and the presence of a limited cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. 
These results support the evaluation of B7-H3 blockers and/or pro-inflammatory
therapies in SCLC.

BACKGROUND: CEA, CYFRA21-1 and NSE are tumor markers used for monitoring the
response to chemotherapy in advanced adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma and 
small-cell lung cancer, respectively. Their role in cancer immunotherapy needs to
be elucidated.
METHODS: Patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were treated
with nivolumab 3 mg/kg every 2 weeks within the Italian Nivolumab Expanded Access
Program. Blood samples were collected at baseline, at each cycle up to cycle 5
and then every two cycles until patient's withdrawn from the study. All patients 
underwent a CT-scan after every 4 cycles of treatment and responses were
classified according to RECIST 1.1. The biomarkers serum levels were measured
with a chemiluminescent microparticle immunoassay for CEA and with an immuno
radiometric assay for CYFRA21-1 and NSE. The markers values at baseline and after
4 cycles were used to analyze the relationship between their variation over
baseline and the tumor response, evaluated as disease control rate (DCR:
CR + PR + SD), and survival (PFS and OS).
RESULTS: A total of 70 patients were evaluable for the analysis. Overall, a
disease control was obtained in 24 patients (35.8%, 4 PR + 20 SD). After 4 cycles
of nivolumab a CEA or CYFRA21-1 reduction ≥ 20% over the baseline was
significantly associated with DCR (CEA, p = 0.021; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001), PFS
(CEA, p = 0.028; CYFRA21-1, p < 0.001) and OS (CEA, p = 0.026; CYFRA21-1,
p = 0.019). Multivariate analysis confirmed the ability of CYFRA21-1
reduction ≥ 20% to predict DCR (p = 0.002) and PFS (p < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: The reduction in serum level of CYFRA21-1 or CEA might be a reliable 
biomarker to predict immunotherapy efficacy in NSCLC patients. NSE was not
significant for monitoring the efficacy of nivolumab.

cells.

University, Shenyang, Liaoning, China.

Ubiquitin activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) is a basic component of E1-activating enzyme
in the SUMOylation system. Expression and function of UBA2 in human cancers are
largely unknown. In this study we investigate UBA2 expression the function in
human non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunochemistry study showed that UBA2 was
overexpressed in cancer tissues (53.3%, 40 of 75) compared with normal lung
tissues (14.3%, 4 of 28) (P < 0.05). Immunostaining of UBA2 was mainly detected
in nucleus. Overexpression of UBA2 in cancer tissues was significantly associated
with poor differentiation, large tumor size ( > 5.0 cm), higher T stages
(T3 + 4), lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages (III + IV). In vitro
study showed that UBA2 was expressed in A549, 95D, H1975, and H1299 cells.
Knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation
and upregulated cancer cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cell significantly increased the G1 and G2/M phase
cells and reduced the S phase cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression profile after
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells showed that the most related function was cell
cycle, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Western
blot analysis study showed that knockdown of UBA2 significantly inhibited
expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, mini-chromosome maintenance 7
(MCM7), MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7. These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical
cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this
malignant tumor.

BACKGROUND: Aggressive behavior of tumor metastasis comes from certain mutations,
changes in cellular metabolic and signaling pathways that are majorly altered by 
tumor microenvironment (TME), its other components and growth factors like
transforming growth factor-β1 (TGF-β1) which is chiefly known for its epithelial 
to mesenchymal transformation (EMT). EMT is a critical step of metastasis cascade
in actual human lung cancer scenario.
OBJECTIVE: Our present study is focused to unveil the in-vivo metastatic behavior
of TGF-β1 treated lung cancer cells that undergone EMT.
METHODS: The lung cancer epithelial A549 cells were treated in-vitro with TGF-β1 
(3-5ng/ml for 72 h) for EMT. After confirming the transformation of cells by
phenotype modifications, wound healing and cell migration assay and qRT-PCR
analyses of EMT biomarkers including E. Cadherin, Vimentin, Snail, Slug, MMP2 and
MMP9; those TGF-β1 modified cells were probed with fluorescent trackers and were 
injected into tail vein of BALB/c nude mice for metastatic dissemination studies.
RESULTS: Our findings indicate that distribution of TGF-β1 treated A549 cells as 
compared to W.T A549 towards lungs is less in terms of total relative fluorescent
cluster count, however the difference is insignificant (52±4, 60±5 respectively).
Additionally we show that TGF-β1 treated cells tend to metastasize almost 2, 3,
1.5, 2 and 1.7 times more than W.T towards liver, brain, ovaries, bones and
adrenal gland respectively which is very much like human lung cancer metastasis.
CONCLUSION: Conclusively it is ever first study reporting that a pre-treatment of
cells with TGF-β1 for experimental lung cancer metastasis mouse model may portray
more precise approach for the development of potential therapeutic treatments.
Additional pre-treatment studies with the application of other TME conditions
like hypoxia and factors like NFκB, VEGF etc. may be a future prospect to develop
a better understanding.

To investigate the associations between the functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-125 family and the survival of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we systematically selected six functional SNPs
located in three pre-miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b-1, miR-125b-2). Cox proportional 
hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Reporter gene
luciferase assay was performed to examine the relationship between the SNPs and
transcriptive activity of the miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs in different cells
was detected using quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that rs2241490
(upstream of miR-125b-1, G > A, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.014,
in dominant model; adjusted HR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.03-1.35, P = 0.014, in additive 
model), rs512932 (upstream of miR-125b-1, A > G, dominant model: adjusted
HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.013) and rs8111742 (upstream of miR-125a,
G > A, dominant model: adjusted HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.71-1.00, P = 0.047) were
associated with the prognosis of 1001 Chinese NSCLC patients. The combined
analysis of the three SNPs related the number of risk alleles (rs2241490-A,
rs512932-G and rs8111742-G) to death risk of NSCLC in a locus-dosage mode (P for 
trend <0.001). Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay showed significantly
higher levels of luciferase activity with rs512932 variant G than that with A
allele in 293T, SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines. Besides, miR-125b was highly
expressed in lung cancer cells than the normal lung cell. Our study indicated
that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of
NSCLC patients. Larger population-based and functional studies are needed to
verify these findings.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by
inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the
effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC
gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were
identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical
evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants
with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS)
were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1
Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing
and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366
patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or 
Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set 
(HR adjusted for age, gender, smoking habits, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status, histology, and stage [aHR] and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87,
Cox P=0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 
and 0.36-0.93, Cox P=0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1
gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an
important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC
patients.

BACKGROUND/AIM: No definitive biomarker exists for predicting treatment efficacy 
or response to therapy with antibody to programmed cell death-1 (PD1) for
patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hence, we investigated
whether the Glasgow prognostic score (GPS) predicted anti-PD1 treatment response 
for advanced NSCLC.
PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study retrospectively identified 47 patients with
NSCLC treated with anti-PD1 and assessed the prognostic value of the GPS. The GPS
was calculated using C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations 1 month after 
starting anti-PD1 treatment. Kaplan-Meier method and Cox proportional hazard
models were used to examine differences in progression-free (PFS) and overall
(OS) survival, and clinical response.
RESULTS: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted anti-PD1 treatment
efficacy, as a good post-treatment GPS (GPS 0-1) was significantly associated
with improved PFS. Intra-treatment GPS change was associated with clinical
response.
CONCLUSION: The post-treatment GPS independently predicted efficacy of anti-PD1
treatment for NSCLC.

Formenti et al. have recently reported the clinical outcomes and translational
readouts of a trial of the anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, in combination with
palliative radiotherapy in 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A
radiological response was seen in 18% of patients and 31% of patients experienced
disease control. These clinical outcomes appear to be superior to historical
studies using ipilimumab alone and suggest that radiation may have triggered
systemic, so-called abscopal, immune responses in some patients. Induction of
interferon-beta (IFN-β) and maximal expansion and contraction of distinct T cell 
receptor clones were the most significant factors predicting response.
Importantly, established predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy
alone, including the expression of PD-L1 in diagnostic biopsies and tumour
mutational burden, did not predict response. The report provides important human 
qualification of pre-clinical mechanistic insights indicating that abscopal
responses can be generated with optimised radiotherapy fractionation schedules
and anti-CTLA-4 inhibition. Additionally, an intriguing mechanism by which
radiation can be immunogenic is described, namely radiation-induced
transcriptional upregulation of neo-antigens.

Pemetrexed (MTA) is a folate antimetabolite used for treating non-small cell lung
cancer. To elucidate the mechanisms of pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer, we
established pemetrexed-resistant sublines in PC9 (mutant EGFR) and H1993
(wild-type EGFR) lung adenocarcinoma cell lines (PC9-MTA, H1993-MTA). Gene
expression profile comparison by microarray analyses revealed enhanced fibroblast
growth factor 2 (FGF2) and FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) expression, confirmed by
Western blotting, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and reverse
transcription-polymerase chain reaction. ERK phosphorylation was increased in
PC9-MTA but decreased in H1993-MTA along with decreased downstream signaling
molecule phosphorylation. Cellular morphological change from epithelial to
spindle-shape together with increased mesenchymal marker protein expression was
observed in H1993-MTA. SiRNA-mediated FGF2 knockdown partially restored
pemetrexed sensitivity in both lines, whereas anti-FGFR1 inhibitor PD173074
restored pemetrexed sensitivity in PC9-MTA. FGF2 or FGFR1 inhibition decreased
pERK levels in PC9-MTA but increased pEGFR levels together with downstream
signaling molecule activation and reversed epithelial-mesenchymal transition
marker protein expression in H1993-MTA. Although thymidylate synthase strongly
facilitates the development of pemetrexed resistance, our results reveal
involvement of the FGF2-FGFR1 pathway in pemetrexed resistance in lung cancer
cells and suggest that cellular function alterations induced by FGF2-FGFR1
pathway activation depend on the innate feature of cancer cells.

Pulmonary sarcomatoid carcinomas (PSC) are a rare group of lung cancer with a
median overall survival of 9-12 months. PSC are divided into five histotypes,
challenging to diagnose and treat. The identification of PSC biomarkers is
warranted, but PSC molecular profile remains to be defined. Herein, a targeted
whole transcriptome analysis was performed on 14 PSC samples, evaluated also for 
the presence of the main oncogene mutations and rearrangements. PSC expression
data were compared with transcriptome data of lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and
squamous cell carcinomas (LUSC) from The Cancer Genome Atlas. Deregulated genes
were used for pathway enrichment analysis; the most representative genes were
tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in an independent cohort (30 PSC, 31 LUAD,
31 LUSC). All PSC cases were investigated for PD-L1 expression. Thirty-eight
genes deregulated in PSC were identified, among these IGJ and SLMAP were
confirmed by IHC. Moreover, Forkhead box signaling and Fanconi anemia pathways
were specifically enriched in PSC. Finally, some PSC harboured alterations in
genes targetable by tyrosine kinase inhibitors, as EGFR and MET. We provide a
deep molecular characterization of PSC; the identification of specific molecular 
profiles, besides increasing our knowledge on PSC biology, might suggest new
strategies to improve patients management.

Gustave Roussy Immune Score Is a Prognostic Factor for Chemotherapy-Naive
Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma With Wild-Type Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

Background: The Gustave Roussy Immune Score (GRIm-Score) was developed based on
the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score for the purpose of a better
patient selection for immunotherapy phase I trials. This scoring system is simply
calculated by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
serum albumin concentration. The aim of our study was to determine whether
GRIm-Score is a practically useful prognostic biomarker for advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or
epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
Methods: This retrospective and single institutional study collected 185
adenocarcinomas without active EGFR mutation, 115 squamous cell carcinomas
treated with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 140 NSCLCs with mutant EGFR
treated with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy. These treatments
were initiated between July 2007 and March 2018 at our hospital. We compared
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low
GRIm-Score groups. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we also
found prognostic factors of survival times.
Results: The OS and PFS of low GRIm-Score group were significantly longer than
those of high-score group in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (low vs. high; median 
OS, 18.4 vs. 5.1 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 5.8 vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.01) 
and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (median OS, 38.9 vs. 10.4 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS,
15.9 vs. 5.0 months, P < 0.01). Subsequent multivariate analyses detected high
GRIm-Score in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma as a poor prognostic factor of OS
(hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.47 - 3.31, P < 0.01), and in the EGFR-mutant
NSCLC as a poor prognostic factor of PFS (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00 - 3.55, P =
0.049).
Conclusions: High GRIm-Score was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS of
first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma and of PFS of
first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Therefore, GRIm-Score
is not only a specific selection marker for experimental immunotherapy trials,
but may also be a promising and useful pretreatment prognostic maker for specific
NSCLC subsets in the real-world practice.

Pretreatment Lung Immune Prognostic Index Is a Prognostic Marker of Chemotherapy 
and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitor.

Background: Lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) was recently developed on the
basis of the combination of baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio
(dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This index was demonstrated as a specific
biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We aimed to show that LIPI may be a useful biomarker of cytotoxic chemotherapy
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for
NSCLC.
Methods: We retrospectively collected 175 wild-type EGFR adenocarcinomas, 131
NSCLCs harboring mutant EGFR and 110 squamous cell carcinomas. All patients
initiated first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI monotherapy between July 
2007 and August 2017 at our hospital. These patients were divided into good,
intermediate and poor LIPI groups. We compared their overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analyses detected prognostic and
predictive factors of OS and PFS.
Results: The good LIPI group survived longer than the intermediate and poor LIPI 
groups in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups:
median 19.6, 11.5 and 3.3 months, P < 0.01, respectively) and mutant EGFR NSCLC
(45.4, 25.6 and 15.7 months, P < 0.01). The PFS of good LIPI group was
significantly longer that those of the other two groups in mutant EGFR NSCLC
(16.6, 12.6 and 8.3 months, P < 0.01). The intermediate group (hazard ratio (HR) 
1.49, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.15, P = 0.04) of wild-type EGFR
adenocarcinoma, intermediate (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 - 3.99, P < 0.01) and poor (HR
2.76, 95% CI 1.03 - 7.42, P = 0.04) groups of mutant EGFR NSCLC were independent 
prognostic factors of poor OS. The intermediate (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.44, P =
0.04) and poor (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.14 - 6.07, P = 0.02) groups were significant
prognostic factors of PFS of mutant EGFR NSCLC.
Conclusions: LIPI was an independent prognostic factor of chemotherapy for
adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR and of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC harboring mutant
EGFR. Thus, LIPI was not a specific biomarker for ICI therapy, but a useful
biomarker for chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI therapy in specific subsets of NSCLC.

In lung cancer, antiangiogenic strategies targeting tumor-derived endothelial
cells (TECs) afford a survival advantage, but the characteristics of TECs have
not been comprehensively elucidated. Herein, high-purity (> 98%) TECs were
obtained, and these cells retained expression of EC markers and exhibited high
viability. ITRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS was performed to profile the proteome and the
heterogeneity of ECs. Only 31 of 1820 identified proteins were differentially
expressed between adenocarcinoma (ADC)- and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-derived
TECs (TEC-A and TEC-S, respectively), and cadherin-2 (CDH2) was the most
significantly upregulated protein in TEC-A samples. Positive immunostaining for
CDH2 (score > 3) was significantly more frequent in the endothelium of ADC
tissues than in that of SCC tissues. Loss- or gain-of-function analysis showed
that CDH2 significantly promoted in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and
sensitivity to the antagonist exherin. The MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNK signaling
pathways may play crucial roles in CDH2-induced HIF-1α/VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis. Moreover, high CDH2 expression in TECs was significantly associated
with tumor stage, visceral pleural metastasis, and decreased overall survival in 
patients with ADC but not SCC. Together, these data indicate the importance of
CDH2 in angiogenesis and highlight its potential both for antiangiogenic therapy 
and as a candidate prognostic marker for ADC.

Treatment of advanced-stage or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, which can now be treated with
molecularly targeted therapies, had been based on cytotoxic chemotherapy for a
long time. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed
against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have
transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the
reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their
efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was
validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab,
atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with
chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III 
trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in
combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation
burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most
from first-line ICI use.

OBJECTIVE: The abnormal expression of the key enzymes in glycolytic pathways,
including glucose transporter-1, glucose transporter-3, hexokinase-II, lactate
dehydrogenase 5, pyruvate kinase M2, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase,
transketolase-like protein 1 and pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase-1 was reported to 
be associated with poor prognosis of various cancers. However, the association
remains controversial. The objective of this study was to investigate the
prognostic significance of glycolysis-related proteins.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Database of
Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, using Pubmed 
and Ovid as search engines and Google Scholar from inception to April 2017.
Eighty-six studies with 12,002 patients were included in the study.
RESULTS: Our pooled results identified that glycolysis-related proteins in
cancers were associated with shorter overall survival of colorectal cancer (HR
2.33, 95% CI 1.38-3.93, P = 0.002), gastric cancer (HR 1.55, 95% CI 1.31-1.82,
P < 0.001), cancer of gallbladder or bile duct (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.70-2.75,
P < 0.001), oral cancer (HR 2.07, 95% CI 1.32-3.25, P < 0.001), esophageal cancer
(HR 1.66, 95% CI 1.25-2.21, P = 0.01), hepatocellular carcinoma (HR 2.04, 95% CI 
1.64-2.54, P < 0.001), pancreatic cancer (HR 1.72, 95% CI 1.39-2.13, P < 0.001), 
breast cancer(HR 1.67, 95% CI 1.34-2.08, P < 0.001), and nasopharyngeal carcinoma
(HR 3.59, 95% CI 1.75-7.36, P < 0.001). No association was found for lung cancer,
ovarian cancer or melanoma. The key glycolytic transcriptional regulators
(HIF-1α, p53) were analyzed in parallel to the glycolysis-related proteins, and
the pooled results identified that high-level expression of HIF-1α was
significantly associated with shorter overall survival (HR 0.57, 95% CI
0.42-0.79, P < 0.001) Furthermore, glycolysis-related proteins linked with poor
differentiated tumors (OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.46-2.25, P < 0.001), positive lymph node
metastasis (OR 2.73, 95% CI 2.16-3.46, P < 0.001), positive vascular invasion (OR
2.05, 95% CI 1.37-3.07, P < 0.001), large tumor size (OR 2.06, 95% CI 1.80-2.37, 
P < 0.001), advanced tumor stage (OR 1.58, 95% CI 1.19-2.09, P < 0.001), and
deeper invasion (OR 2.37, 95% CI 1.93-2.91, P < 0.001).
CONCLUSION: Glycolytic transcriptional regulators and glycolysis-related proteins
in cancers were significantly associated with poor prognosis, suggesting
glycolytic status may be potentially valuable prognostic biomarkers for various
cancers.

Early elevation of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, or CRP, which
is a surrogate marker for IL-6, following commencement of PD-1/L1 inhibitors
(PD1-I) may represent early activation of immune-cells. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were
measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 
7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were
reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the
treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum
levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and
post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453;
TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four
responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response 
rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased
after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably,
in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6
or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median
overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in
the non-elevated group (p = 0.069). The early increase in inflammatory cytokines 
with PD1-I was indicated to be predictive for the efficacy in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer.

Deficiencies in DNA repair pathways, including mismatch repair (MMR), have been
linked to higher tumor mutation burden and improved response to immune checkpoint
inhibitors. However, the significance of MMR mutations in lung cancer has not
been well characterized, and the relevance of other processes, including
homologous recombination (HR) and polymerase epsilon (POLE) activity, remains
unclear. Here, we analyzed a dataset of lung squamous cell carcinoma samples from
The Cancer Genome Atlas. Variants in DNA repair genes were associated with
increased tumor mutation and neoantigen burden, which in turn were linked with
greater tumor infiltration by activated T cells. The subset of tumors with DNA
repair gene variants but without T cell infiltration exhibited upregulation of
TGF-β and Wnt pathway genes, and a combined score incorporating these genes and
DNA repair status accurately predicted immune cell infiltration. Finally, high
neoantigen burden was positively associated with genes related to cytolytic
activity and immune checkpoints. These findings provide evidence that DNA repair 
pathway defects and immunomodulatory genes together lead to specific
immunophenotypes in lung squamous cell carcinoma and could potentially serve as
biomarkers for immunotherapy.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), particularly inhibitors of the PD-1 axis,
have altered the management of non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) over the last
ten years. First demonstrated to improve outcomes in second-line or later therapy
of advanced disease, ICIs were shown to improve overall survival (OS) compared to
chemotherapy in first line therapy for patients whose tumors express PD-L1 on at 
least 50% of cells. More recently, combining ICIs with chemotherapy has been
shown to improve survival in patients with both squamous and nonsquamous NSCLC,
regardless of PD-L1 expression. However, PD-L1 and, more recently, tumor
mutational burden (TMB) have not proven to be straightforward indicative
biomarkers. We describe the advances to date in utilizing these biomarkers, as
well as novel markers of tumor inflammation, to ascertain which patients are most
likely to benefit from ICIs. Ongoing translational work promises to improve the
proportion of patients who benefit from these agents.

The use of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) has become one of the most
promising approaches in the field of cancer therapy. Unlike the current therapies
that target tumor cells, such as chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or targeted therapy,
ICIs directly restore the exhausted host antitumor immune responses mediated by
the tumors. Among multiple immune modulators identified, the programmed cell
death protein 1 (PD-1)/programmed cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) axis
leading to the exhaustion of T-cell immunity in chronic infections and tumors has
been widely investigated. Therefore, blocking antibodies targeting PD-1 or PD-L1 
have been developed and approved for the treatment of various advanced cancers,
including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC), making them the most successful
ICIs. Compared with chemotherapy or radiotherapy, PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy
significantly improves the durable response rate and prolongs long-term survival 
with limited adverse effects in both monotherapy and combination therapy for
advanced NSCLC. However, extensive challenges exist for further clinical
applications, such as a small fraction of benefit population, primary and
acquired resistance, the lack of predictive and prognostic biomarkers, and
treatment-related adverse effects. In this article, we summarize the latest
clinical applications of PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy in advanced NSCLC worldwide,
as well as in China, and discuss the bottlenecks related to the use of this
therapy in clinical practice. An exploration of the underlying mechanism of
PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy and biomarker identification will maximize the
application of ICIs in advanced NSCLC and facilitate bedside-to-bench studies in 
cancer immunotherapy as well. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Immune checkpoint
inhibitors (ICIs) targeting programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed
cell death protein ligand 1 (PD-L1) display apparent benefits for the treatment
of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the clinical
applications of these therapies are challenged by the limited benefit population 
with additional high economic burden and adverse events. This review discusses
the bottlenecks of ICI therapy in clinical practice and provides appropriate
guidance in the development of predictive biomarkers, the establishment of the
criteria for combining PD-1/PD-L1 blockade therapy with the existing therapies,
and the management of adverse events observed both in monotherapy and combination
therapy, which will help maximize the applications of ICIs in advanced NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: HOTTIP, a long non-coding RNA located in the HOXA cluster, plays a
role in the patterning of tissues with mesodermal components, including the lung.
Overexpression of HOXA genes, including HOTTIP, has been associated with a more
aggressive phenotype in several cancers. However, the prognostic impact of HOTTIP
has not yet been explored in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have
correlated HOTTIP expression with time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS)
in early-stage NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Ninety-nine early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection 
in our center from June 2007 to November 2013 were included in the study. Mean
age was 66; 77.8% were males; 73.7% had stage I disease; and 55.5% had
adenocarcinoma. A validation data set comprised stage I-II patients from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network.
RESULTS: HOTTIP was expressed in all tumor samples and was overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.007) and in smokers (p = 0.018). Patients with
high levels of HOTTIP had shorter TTR (78.3 vs 58 months; p = 0.048) and shorter 
OS (81.2 vs 61 months; p = 0.023) than those with low levels. In the multivariate
analysis, HOTTIP emerged as an independent prognostic marker for TTR (OR: 2.05,
95%CI: 1-4.2; p = 0.05), and for OS (OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.04-5.1; p = 0.04). HOTTIP
was validated as a prognostic marker for OS in the TCGA adenocarcinoma cohort
(p = 0.025). Moreover, we identified a 1203-mRNA and a 61-miRNA signature that
correlated with HOTTIP expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The lncRNA HOTTIP can be considered a prognostic biomarker in
early-stage NSCLC.

Lung cancer is a complex disease involving multiple genetic and phenotypic
alterations. As a histone modification enzyme, protein‑arginine deiminase type‑4 
(PADI4) and its downstream signaling have been studied in the progression of a
variety of types of human cancer, but data on PADI4‑mediated posttranslational
modification in lung cancer are lacking. The aim of present study was to evaluate
the expression of PADI4 and its associated molecular signaling in lung cancer
metastasis. The results of the present study indicated that PADI4 was
overexpressed in lung cancer cells, while knockdown of PADI4 could lead to
attenuation of the lung cancer cell invasion and migration phenotype, which was
further verified by determining the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)
marker proteins. Additionally, it was demonstrated that stable knockdown of PADI4
in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a striking reduction of the EMT‑associated 
Snail1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3/4 transcriptional complex, which
was consistent with alterations in migratory and invasive phenotypes of A549 lung
cancer cells. Therefore, PADI4‑mediated EMT transition is proposed to represent a
novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic and phenotypic alterations in lung
cancer cells, and the PADI4 associated signaling pathway may be a therapeutic
target for treating lung cancer in a clinical setting.

Ehm2 [also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1‑like protein 4B
(EPB41L4B)] is a member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. The overexpression of
Ehm2 has been observed in metastatic cancer cells. Through alternative splicing, 
the Ehm2 gene produces two transcript variants that encode the two different
isoforms, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2. The biological functions of these different Ehm2
transcript variants remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the
expression of the Ehm2 variants in lung adenocarcinoma and their involvement in
the disease progression of the patients. The expression of Ehm2 transcript
variants in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues was analyzed using
immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Ehm2 variants were overexpressed 
or knocked down in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The consequent effects
of the genetic modifications on the cellular functions of lung cancer cells were 
then examined using in vitro cell viability, invasion and migration assays. The
expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related markers was
evaluated by western blot analysis in the cell models. The association of Ehm2
variant expression with patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis. The expression of Ehm2/1 was significantly decreased in lung cancers
compared with the paired normal lung tissues (P<0.05), while the Ehm2/2 protein
levels were higher in the tumors than in the paired normal lung tissues, although
this was not statistically significant. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 exerted
inhibitory effects, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 promoted the growth, invasion
and migration of A549 cells in vitro. Ehm2/2 was expressed at low levels in the
A549 cells and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 significantly increased the
invasiveness and migration of the A549 cells. Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that Ehm2/1 was confined to the plasma membrane, while Ehm2/2 was
observed at both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 
resulted in the upregulation of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin, and in the
decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, N‑cadherin and Snail1, while the
knockdown of Ehm2/1 and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 had the opposite
effects on the protein levels of EMT‑related markers. Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis revealed that higher Ehm2/1 transcript levels were associated with the
longer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, while the lower expression 
of Ehm2/2 exhibited a similar association with patient survival. Taken together, 
the two Ehm2 variants appear to be differentially expressed in lung
adenocarcinoma. Ehm2/1 may function as a putative tumor suppressor in the disease
progression of lung adenocarcinoma, while Ehm2/2 may have an opposite function.

BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on lung cancer cells is 
a prognostic marker and a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
However, previous clinical trials have suggested that other programmed cell death
1 ligands, including programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), might have clinical
impacts. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic significance of PD-L2
expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
METHODS: The study included 433 patients who underwent surgical resection for
lung adenocarcinoma between 2003 and 2012 at Kyushu University Hospital. Both
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The cutoff
value for PD-L2 positivity was set at 1% according to a time-dependent receiver
operating characteristic curve for 5-year survival.
RESULTS: Of the 433 patients, 306 (70.7%) were positive for PD-L2. No significant
association between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was observed (P = 0.094). The
multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of PD-L2 positivity 
were never-smoker status (P = 0.002), poor differentiation grade (P = 0.008), and
advanced stage (P = 0.048). The PD-L2-positive patients had significantly shorter
disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.018) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016).
Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 positivity were independent predictors of OS (P < 0.001 and 
P = 0.027, respectively). In the subgroup analysis of the PD-L1-negative
patients, PD-L2 positivity was significantly associated with shorter DFS
(P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of patients
with PD-L1 expression may differ from those of patients with PD-L2 expression,
and that both might contribute to poor prognoses. The potential role of PD-L2
expression as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy should be
investigated in future studies.

Tumor metastasis is a hallmark of cancer, with distant metastasis frequently
developing in lung cancer, even at initial diagnosis, resulting in poor prognosis
and high mortality. However, available biomarkers cannot reliably predict cancer 
spreading sites. The metastatic cascade involves highly complicated processes
including invasion, migration, angiogenesis, and epithelial-to-mesenchymal
transition that are tightly controlled by various genetic expression modalities
along with interaction between cancer cells and the extracellular matrix. In
particular, microRNAs (miRNAs), a group of small non-coding RNAs, can influence
the transcriptional and post-transcriptional processes, with dysregulation of
miRNA expression contributing to the regulation of cancer metastasis.
Nevertheless, although miRNA-targeted therapy is widely studied in vitro and in
vivo, this strategy currently affords limited feasibility and a few
miRNA-targeted therapies for lung cancer have entered into clinical trials to
date. Advances in understanding the molecular mechanism of metastasis will thus
provide additional potential targets for lung cancer treatment. This review
discusses the current research related to the role of miRNAs in lung cancer
invasion and metastasis, with a particular focus on the different metastatic
lesions and potential miRNA-targeted treatments for lung cancer with the
expectation that further exploration of miRNA-targeted therapy may establish a
new spectrum of lung cancer treatments.

BACKGROUND: ING5 is the last member of the Inhibitor of Growth (ING) candidate
tumor suppressor family that has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, 
including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. Our
previous study showed that ING5 overexpression inhibits lung cancer
aggressiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with unknown
mechanisms.
METHODS: Western blotting was used to detect total and phosphorylated levels of
β-catenin and EMT-related proteins. Immunofluorescent staining was used to
observe E-cadherin expression. Proliferation and colony formation, wound healing,
and Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to study the
proliferative and invasive abilities of cancer cells.
RESULTS: ING5 overexpression promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37,
leading to a decreased β-catenin protein level. Small hairpin RNA-mediated ING5
knockdown significantly increased the β-catenin level and inhibited
phosphorylation of β-catenin S33/37. Treatment with the WNT/β-catenin inhibitor
XAV939 inhibited ING5-knockdown promoted proliferation, colony formation,
migration, and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells, with increased phosphorylation
of β-catenin S33/37 and a decreased β-catenin level. XAV939 also impaired
ING5-knockdown-induced EMT, as indicated by upregulated expression of the EMT
marker E-cadherin, an epithelial marker; and decreased expression of N-cadherin, 
a mesenchymal marker, and EMT-related transcription factors, including Snail,
Slug, Twist, and Smad3. Furthermore, XAV939 could inhibit the activation of both 
IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: ING5 inhibits lung cancer invasion and EMT by inhibiting the
WNT/β-catenin pathway.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, whereby mature epithelial 
cells undergo phenotype transition and differentiate into motile, invasive cells,
has been indicated in tumor metastasis. The melatonin hormone secreted by the
pineal gland has an antioxidant effect and protects cells against carcinogenic
substances that reduce tumor progression. However, the effects of melatonin in
EMT and lung cancer metastasis are largely unknown. We found that melatonin
down-regulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription
factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and 
β-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with
tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer
specimens. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited EMT marker expression and lung cancer
metastasis to liver in vivo Finally, melatonin shows promise in the treatment of 
lung cancer metastasis and deserves further study.

BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the association between CYP2A13
polymorphisms and lung cancer susceptibility using the HapMap database.
METHODS: A case-control analysis of 532 subjects with lung cancer and 614
controls with no personal history of the disease was performed. The tag SNPs
rs1645690 and rs8192789 for CYP2A13 were selected, and the genetic polymorphisms 
were confirmed experimentally through real-time PCR, cloning, and sequencing
assay.
RESULTS: SNP frequency in this study was consistent with the HapMap Project
database of Han-Chinese and lung cancer risk was associated with CYP2A13
polymorphisms in non-smokers. CYP2A13 shares a 93.5% identity with CYP2A6 in the 
amino acid sequence and the homologous sequences may interfere with the study of 
SNPs of CYP2A13.
CONCLUSIONS: CYP2A13 may be a potential key metabolic enzyme gene in the
carcinogenesis of lung cancer in non-smokers. The common polymorphisms of CYP2A13
may be candidate biomarkers for lung cancer susceptibility in Han-Chinese.

Cancer, the uncontrolled growth of cells, is a major disease that threatens the
worldwide population. Among all cancer types, lung cancer has the highest
morbidity rate, with a survival rate of less than 5%. Various studies have
focused on discovering a potent anticancer drug that will increase the survival
rate of lung cancer patients. Lutein (3,3'-dihydroxy-β, ε-carotene), a carotenoid
present in fruits and vegetables, is one such compound that possesses excellent
antioxidant properties. The present study was designed to determine the
anticancer effect of lutein against A549, a non-small-cell lung cancer cell line.
The cytotoxic effect of lutein against lung cancer cells (A549 and HCC827) and
normal cells (BEAS-2B) was detected by MTT
(3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) assay. The
Transwell assay was performed to detect the inhibitory potential of lutein
against cell invasion and migration of A549 cells. The induction of apoptosis by 
lutein in A549 was analyzed by a double-staining technique using TUNEL (terminal 
deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated dUTP nick end-labeling) and DAPI
(4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining assays to confirm the molecular
mechanism exhibited by lutein to induce apoptosis through regulating the
phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/AKT signaling molecules that are often
deregulated in cancerous condition. The results show that lutein inhibits the
PI3K/AKT signaling pathway and induces apoptosis in A549, which may therefore be 
used as a potent natural anticancer drug with no side effects to treat lung
cancer.
