Ubiquitin activating enzyme 2 (UBA2) is a basic component of E1-activating enzyme
in the SUMOylation system. Expression and function of UBA2 in human cancers are
largely unknown. In this study we investigate UBA2 expression the function in
human non-small-cell lung cancer. Immunochemistry study showed that UBA2 was
overexpressed in cancer tissues (53.3%, 40 of 75) compared with normal lung
tissues (14.3%, 4 of 28) (P < 0.05). Immunostaining of UBA2 was mainly detected
in nucleus. Overexpression of UBA2 in cancer tissues was significantly associated
with poor differentiation, large tumor size ( > 5.0 cm), higher T stages
(T3 + 4), lymph node metastasis and advanced TNM stages (III + IV). In vitro
study showed that UBA2 was expressed in A549, 95D, H1975, and H1299 cells.
Knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells significantly inhibited cancer cell proliferation
and upregulated cancer cell apoptosis (P < 0.05). Cell cycle analysis showed that
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cell significantly increased the G1 and G2/M phase
cells and reduced the S phase cells (P < 0.05). Gene expression profile after
knockdown of UBA2 in A549 cells showed that the most related function was cell
cycle, cell death and survival, and cellular growth and proliferation. Western
blot analysis study showed that knockdown of UBA2 significantly inhibited
expression of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1, mini-chromosome maintenance 7
(MCM7), MCM2, MCM3 and MCM7. These results indicated that UBA2 was a critical
cell cycle and proliferation regulator and may be a novel cancer marker in this
malignant tumor.

To investigate the associations between the functional single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) in the miR-125 family and the survival of non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, we systematically selected six functional SNPs
located in three pre-miRNAs (miR-125a, miR-125b-1, miR-125b-2). Cox proportional 
hazard regression analyses were conducted to estimate the crude and adjusted
hazard ratios (HRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Reporter gene
luciferase assay was performed to examine the relationship between the SNPs and
transcriptive activity of the miRNAs. The expression of miRNAs in different cells
was detected using quantitative real-time PCR assay. We found that rs2241490
(upstream of miR-125b-1, G > A, adjusted HR = 1.24, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.014,
in dominant model; adjusted HR = 1.18, 95%CI = 1.03-1.35, P = 0.014, in additive 
model), rs512932 (upstream of miR-125b-1, A > G, dominant model: adjusted
HR = 1.25, 95%CI = 1.05-1.48, P = 0.013) and rs8111742 (upstream of miR-125a,
G > A, dominant model: adjusted HR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.71-1.00, P = 0.047) were
associated with the prognosis of 1001 Chinese NSCLC patients. The combined
analysis of the three SNPs related the number of risk alleles (rs2241490-A,
rs512932-G and rs8111742-G) to death risk of NSCLC in a locus-dosage mode (P for 
trend <0.001). Furthermore, luciferase reporter gene assay showed significantly
higher levels of luciferase activity with rs512932 variant G than that with A
allele in 293T, SPC-A1 and A549 cell lines. Besides, miR-125b was highly
expressed in lung cancer cells than the normal lung cell. Our study indicated
that genetic variations in miR-125 family were implicated in the survival of
NSCLC patients. Larger population-based and functional studies are needed to
verify these findings.

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) 1 and 2 function as tumor suppressors by
inactivating the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway. Although the
effect of platinum on TSC function has been studied, associations between TSC
gene variants and survival of cancer patients treated with platinum-based
chemotherapy were not evaluated. Genetic variants of TSC1 and TSC2 were
identified by next-generation sequencing and selected for further clinical
evaluation based on predetermined criteria. Associations of the gene variants
with treatment outcomes (progression-free survival, PFS; overall survival, OS)
were evaluated in testing and validation sets of patients with advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence
intervals (CIs) were estimated with the multivariable Cox model. The TSC1
Met322Thr (rs1073123) variant met the criteria for further analysis in testing
and validation sets each containing 183 patients. The median PFS for the 366
patients was 4.9 months. Fifty-three patients (14.5%) had the TSC1 (Met322Thr or 
Thr322Thr) variant. TSC1 Met322Thr associated with longer PFS in the testing set 
(HR adjusted for age, gender, smoking habits, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group 
performance status, histology, and stage [aHR] and 95% CI: 0.63 and 0.45-0.87,
Cox P=0.009), and this was confirmed in the validation set (aHR and 95% CI: 0.58 
and 0.36-0.93, Cox P=0.004). However, no association was found between the TSC1
gene variant and OS. These findings suggest that the TSC1 gene variant is an
important predictive marker for platinum doublet chemotherapy outcomes in NSCLC
patients.

OBJECTIVE: Human U three protein 14a (hUTP14a) facilitates tumorigenesis through 
promoting p53 and Rb degradation as well as enhancing c-Myc oncogenic activity.
Moreover, hUTP14a expression is up-regulated in human hepatocellular cancer and
colorectal cancer tissues. In this study, the expression of hUTP14a in non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues was evaluated by immunohistochemistry staining
(IHC). The relationship between hUTP14a expression levels and the clinical
characteristics of the NSCLC patients were analyzed.
METHODS: Lung cancer tissues and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues were
collected from 123 cases of NSCLC patients including 53 cases of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and 70 cases of adenocarcinoma (ADC), who had accepted surgical
resection at Peking University Third Hospital from May 2003 to April 2006. The
expression level of hUTP14a was determined by IHC in human NSCLC tissues and the 
adjacent non-cancerous tissues. The associations between hUTP14a expression and
the clinical pathological variables including gender, age, tumor size,
histological type, differentiation degree and clinical pathological stage were
analyzed using the Pearson's χ2 test.
RESULTS: The expression rate of hUTP14a in NSCLC tissues was significantly higher
than that in the non-cancerous tissues (37.4% vs. 0, P<0.001). The expressions of
hUTP14a in lung ADC and SCC were 48.6% and 20.6%, respectively. The expression
rate of hUTP14a in both lung ADC and SCC was significantly higher than that in
the adjacent non-cancerous tissues (P<0.001). In addition, the expression rate of
hUTP14a in lung ADC was significantly higher than that in SCC (χ2=8.66, P=0.003).
Furthermore, the expression rate of hUTP14a in the late pTNM stage of SCC was
significantly higher than that in the early pTNM stage of SCC while hUTP14a
expression level was not associated with pTNM stage of ADC. No correlation was
found between hUTP14a expression and the other clinical pathologic features of
the patients.
CONCLUSION: Expression of hUTP14a was up-regulated in NSCLC tissues and was
correlated with pTNM stage of SCC, suggesting that hUTP14a might possess a
potential as a candidate marker for the early diagnosis screening of NSCLC.

PURPOSE: We aimed to analyze the expression of ZWINT, NUSAP1, DLGAP5, and PRC1 in
tumor tissues and adjacent tissues with public data.
METHODS: The expression patterns of four genes were detected in cancer tissues
and adjacent tissues by qRT-PCR. The overall survival analysis was used to
explore these genes in lung adenocarcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma patients. 
Knockdown assays were used to select the most suitable gene among these four
genes. Cell function assays with the knockdown gene were conducted in A549 and
NCL H226 cells. The role of the knockdown gene in lung cancer was dissected in a 
mice tumor model. Transcriptome sequencing analyses with the knockdown gene were 
analyzed.
RESULTS: Overexpression of these genes was significantly detected in cancer
tissues (P < 0.01). Overall survival revealed that high expression of these genes
is closely related with poor prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma patients
(P < 0.05). Knockdown of ZWINT reduced proliferation in NCI H226 and A549 cells
(P < 0.05). Knockdown also inhibited cell migration, invasion, apoptosis, and
colony formation (P < 0.05). ZWINT knockdown reduced tumor volume (P < 0.05).
Transcriptome sequencing of ZWINT knockdown-treated A549 and NCI H226 cells
indicated that 100 and 426 differentially expressed genes were obtained,
respectively. Gene ontology analysis suggested that binding, biological
regulation, and multicellular organismal processes were the most enriched. KEGG
analysis revealed that TNF, P53, and PI3K signal networks would be the most
potential ZWINT-related pathways and were identified by Western blot analysis.
CONCLUSIONS: ZWINT may be a novel target for lung cancer therapy.

PURPOSE: Mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 are associated with a
variety of cancers. Therefore, it is important to know the occurrence and
prognostic effects of TP53 mutations in certain cancers.
METHODS: Over 29,000 cases from the April 2016 release of the International
Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) TP53 Database were analyzed to determine the
distribution of germline and somatic mutations in the TP53 gene. Subsequently,
7,893 cancer cases were compiled in cBioPortal for Cancer Genomics from the 33
most recent The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) studies to determine the prevalence of
TP53 mutations in cancers and their effects on survival and disease-free survival
times.
RESULTS: The data were analyzed, and it was found that the majority of TP53
mutations were missense and the major mutational hotspots were located at codons 
248, 273, 175, and 245 in exons 4-8 for somatic mutations with the addition of
codon 337 and other mutations in exons 9-10 for germline mutations. Out of 33
TGCA studies, the effects of TP53 mutations were statistically significant in
nine cancers (lung adenocarcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, head and neck
squamous cell carcinoma, acute myeloid leukemia, clear cell renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC), papillary RCC, chromophobe RCC, uterine endometrial carcinoma, and
thymoma) for survival time and in five cancers (pancreatic adenocarcinoma,
hepatocellular carcinoma, chromophobe RCC, acute myeloid leukemia, and thymoma)
for disease-free survival time. It was also found that the most common p53
mutation in hepatocellular carcinomas (R249S) was a much better indicator for
poor prognosis than TP53 mutations as a whole. In addition, in cases of ovarian
serous cystadenocarcinoma, the co-occurrence of TP53 and BRCA mutations resulted 
in longer survival and disease-free survival times than the presence of neither
TP53 nor BRCA mutations.
CONCLUSION: TP53 mutations are potential prognostic markers that can be used to
further improve the accuracy of predicting survival and disease-free survival
times of cancer patients.

Background: Lung cancer is one of the most common malignant tumors. Despite
advances in lung cancer therapies, prognosis of non-small-cell lung cancer is
still unfavorable. The aim of this study was to identify the prognostic value of 
key genes in lung tumorigenesis.
Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened out by GEO2R from
three Gene Expression Omnibus cohorts. Common DEGs were selected for Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway analysis and Gene Ontology enrichment
analysis. Protein- protein interaction networks were constructed by the STRING
database and visualized by Cytoscape software. Hub genes, filtered from the
CytoHubba, were validated using the Gene Expression Profiling Interactive
Analysis database, and their genomic alterations were identified by performing
the cBioportal. Finally, overall survival analysis of hub genes was performed
using Kaplan-Meier Plotter.
Results: From three datasets, 169 DEGs (70 upregulated and 99 downregulated) were
identified. Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway
analyses showed that upregulated DEGs were significantly enriched in cell cycle, 
p53 pathway, and extracellular matrix-receptor interactions; the downregulated
DEGs were significantly enriched in PPAR pathway and tyrosine metabolism. The
protein-protein interaction network consisted of 71 nodes and 305 edges,
including 49 upregulated and 22 downregulated genes. The hub genes, including
AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, were overexpressed compared with the
normal group by Gene Expression Profiling Interactive Analysis analysis, and
associated with reduced overall survival in lung cancer patients. In the genomic 
alterations analysis, two hotspot mutations (S2021C/F and E314K/V) were
identified in Pfam protein domains.
Conclusion: DEGs, including AURKB, BUB1B, KIF2C, HMMR, CENPF, and CENPU, might be
potential biomarkers for the prognosis and treatment of lung adenocarcinoma.

Lung cancer, of which non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for ~85% of
cases, remains a leading cause of cancer-associated mortality and morbidity
worldwide. Tumor suppressor p53 is a master regulator of diverse cellular
processes and is a therapeutic target in cancer. However, many aspects of its
transcriptional regulation are still not well defined. WD repeat containing
antisense to TP53α (Wrap53α) a newly identified natural antisense transcript of
p53, can regulate p53 expression following DNA damage. The present study
determined the methylation status of the Wrap53α promoter in primary lung tissues
using methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction and evaluated its
associations with clinicopathological features and survival in patients with
NSCLC. The Wrap53α promoter was methylated in 12 (8.2%) of 146 malignant tissues.
Its methylation was associated with the downregulation of its transcription and
was frequently detected in patients with stages II-IIIA (P=0.03), and p53
mutation-negative cases (P=0.08). Methylation of Wrap53α promoter was associated 
with worse overall survival of total patients with a borderline significance
[adjusted Hazard Ratio (HR)=2.44, 95% Confidence Interval (CI)=0.98-6.04,
P=0.05]. Notably, Wrap53α promoter methylation significantly associated with poor
overall survival in p53 mutation-negative patients (log-rank P=0.01, adjusted
HR=2.92, 95% CI=1.00-8.60, P=0.05), but not in patients with p53 mutations. The
results of the present study suggest that Wrap53α may serve a role in the
pathogenesis of a subset of lung cancer, and its methylation may be considered to
be a prognostic marker for surgically resected NSCLC patients. However, further
studies with a larger sample size are required to confirm this finding.

Cyclic long noncoding RNAs have recently become major players in cancer biology
and can serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and prognosis, and as potential 
therapeutic targets. We explored circulating LINC00342 as a predictor of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The expression of LINC00342 in tissues,
serum, PBMC, and NSCLC cell lines were screened by reverse transcription
quantitative polymerase chain reaction. A multistage validation and risk score
formula detection analysis was used. The effect of LINC00342 on proliferation was
assessed by MTT, p53, and PTEN pathways, which were analyzed by Western blot
analysis. We found that LINC00342 was upregulated in the tissues, serum, and PBMC
of patients with NSCLC. In addition, patients with higher LINC00342 expression
levels were associated with poor overall survival. For the diagnosis of NSCLC,
the specificity and sensitivity of LINC00342 were significantly higher than that 
of CYFRA 21-1. Moreover, LINC00342 promoted proliferation by inhibiting the
expression of p53 and PTEN proteins in NSCLC cell lines. Our study demonstrates
that LINC00342 is involved in the development, and LINC00342 may be a potential
diagnostic factor and a target for new therapies for future patients with NSCLC.

Clinical significance of interleukin-6 in diagnosis of lung, oral, esophageal,
and gall bladder carcinomas.

Author information:

Introduction: Chronic inflammation predisposes to cancer. Cytokines play an
essential role in cancer pathogenesis. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) is a pleiotropic
cytokine that enables growth and differentiation of tumors. The effects of IL-6
are mediated by signal transducers and activators of transcription 3 (STAT3).
STAT3 deficiency reduced tumor incidence and growth while STAT3 hyperactivation
has an opposite effect; also it negatively regulates p53 gene. IL-6/STAT3
signaling is crucial in carcinogenesis linked to inflammation. Increased IL-6
levels are observed in cancer. Studies investigating the role of IL-6 is limited.
Aim: This study aims at determining IL-6 levels in lung, oral, esophageal, and
gallbladder cancer patients.
Materials and Methods: Subjects consisted of 175 patients with lung, oral, gall
bladder, and esophageal cancers. The patients included 68 females and 107 males
with an average age of 52 years. Fifty healthy individuals served as controls.
IL-6 was detected by electrochemiluminescent immunoassay principle.
Results: IL-6 values were determined in 175 (21 lung, 55 oral, 17 esophageal and 
82 gallbladder) cancer patients. Of these, 147/175 (18 lung, 43 oral, 13
esophageal and 73 gallbladder) cancer patients (84%) showed higher IL-6 levels as
compared to control group (normal range: <7 pg/ml).
Conclusion: This indicates a significant correlation between IL-6 overexpression 
and cancer development, highlighting the significance of IL-6 in oral, lung,
esophageal, and gallbladder carcinomas. IL-6 may be used as a tumor marker for
cancer diagnosis. It may be a clinically significant predictor and may represent 
a target for cancer treatment. However, to definitely conclude this, further
extensive studies would be required.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cancer diagnosis worldwide and the number 
one cause of cancer deaths. Exposure to cigarette smoke, the primary risk factor 
in lung cancer, reduces epithelial barrier integrity and increases susceptibility
to infections. Herein, we hypothesize that somatic mutations together with
cigarette smoke generate a dysbiotic microbiota that is associated with lung
carcinogenesis. Using lung tissue from 33 controls and 143 cancer cases, we
conduct 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) bacterial gene sequencing, with RNA-sequencing
data from lung cancer cases in The Cancer Genome Atlas serving as the validation 
cohort.
RESULTS: Overall, we demonstrate a lower alpha diversity in normal lung as
compared to non-tumor adjacent or tumor tissue. In squamous cell carcinoma
specifically, a separate group of taxa are identified, in which Acidovorax is
enriched in smokers. Acidovorax temporans is identified within tumor sections by 
fluorescent in situ hybridization and confirmed by two separate 16S rRNA
strategies. Further, these taxa, including Acidovorax, exhibit higher abundance
among the subset of squamous cell carcinoma cases with TP53 mutations, an
association not seen in adenocarcinomas.
CONCLUSIONS: The results of this comprehensive study show both microbiome-gene
and microbiome-exposure interactions in squamous cell carcinoma lung cancer
tissue. Specifically, tumors harboring TP53 mutations, which can impair
epithelial function, have a unique bacterial consortium that is higher in
relative abundance in smoking-associated tumors of this type. Given the
significant need for clinical diagnostic tools in lung cancer, this study may
provide novel biomarkers for early detection.

The tumour‑suppressor protein p53 is a key regulator of multiple cellular
processes and exerts its tumour‑suppressor function by inducing apoptotic cell
death. However, emerging evidence indicates that p53 is also involved in inducing
ferroptosis, which is a unique iron‑dependent form of non‑apoptotic cell death
triggered by the RAS‑selective lethal small molecule erastin. Previous studies
have shown that erastin exposure induces increased ROS accumulation and oxidative
stress. In the present study, we incubated A549 cells with erastin and detected
ROS accumulation. Semi‑quantitative western blotting was performed to analyse the
effect of the induced ROS on p53 activity. To determine how ROS activate p53,
NAC, an ROS scavenger, and KU‑55933, an ATM kinase inhibitor, were employed to
co‑incubate with erastin, followed by western blot analysis. Either p53 or
SLC7A11 siRNA was introduced into A549 cells to silence the target‑gene
expression, followed by ROS detection to illustrate the regulatory role of
ROS‑activated p53 on its target gene SLC7A11. Annexin V‑FITC/PI staining was
performed to detect the induction of apoptotic cell death by erastin exposure. To
further assess the effects of erastin treatment on cellular proliferation, EdU
staining and cell cycle flow cytometric analysis were performed. Erastin exposure
upregulated and activated p53 and thus, transcriptionally activated its
downstream target genes, including p21 and Bax, in lung cancer A549 cells
dependent on erastin‑induced ROS. Subsequently, activated p53 by erastin
treatment suppressed SLC7A11 and induced ROS accumulation, indicating the
potential feedback loop between p53 and erastin‑induced ROS. By employing the
caspase inhibitor Z‑VAD‑FMK, it was revealed that erastin‑induced p53 contributed
to both ferroptotic and apoptotic cell death and inhibited cell proliferation via
arresting the cell cycle at G1 phase. Collectively, these results indicated that 
p53 may contribute to the cytotoxic and cytostatic effects associated with
establishing a feedback loop with ROS induced by erastin.

Small cell carcinoma (SCC) is a highly malignant neuroendocrine tumor that may
occur in many anatomic sites of the body.In this study, we compared the different
expression of neuroendocrine markers, thyroid transcription factor 1 (TTF-1),
p53, and Ki-67 in 23 cases of cervical SCC and 56 cases of pulmonary SCC using
immunohistochemistry.Our study showed that cervical SCC had a younger onset age
than pulmonary counterpart. Although both had the similar morphological features,
different immunohistochemical expression panel was observed in this study. As
neuroendocrine tumors, SCC of cervix and lung had similar immunoreactive staining
for CD56 and chromogranin A, but the expression of the synaptophysin in cervical 
SCC was significantly higher than that in pulmonary SCC (P = .007). The TTF-1
expression of pulmonary SCC illustrating diffuse and strong positivity in tumor
cell nuclei was significantly higher than that of the cervical SCC (P = .003).
There was only 1 case showing p53 protein over-expression in the 23 cases of
cervical SCC, and p53 over-expression was observed in 42.9% of pulmonary SCC
(P = .001). Only 9 cases of cervical SCC showed ≥80% of the Ki-67 proliferation
index, while it was found in 94.6% of pulmonary SCC (P < .001).The different
immunohistochemical expressions of these 2 kinds of SCCs may be related with
their pathogenetic mechanism, and these differences may be helpful in the
identification of the origins of the metastatic SCC with unknown primary site.

In recent years, the incidence of non‑small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has become
the highest lethal rate of cancer worldwide. Molecular assays of EGFR, KRAS,
BRAF, NRAS, PIK3CA and Her‑2 are widely used to guide individualized treatment in
NSCLC patients. Somatic mutations in 112 NSCLC patients, including 7 oncogenic
driver genes, were detected by Iontorrent personal genome machine (PGM). Sanger
sequencing was used to test and verify the results of PGM. Apart from uncommon
mutations of EGFR, 101 NSCLC specimens were tested by droplet digital PCR
(ddPCR). According to NGS results, mutations were detected in EGFR (58/112,
51.79% of tumors), KRAS (10/112, 8.93%), BRAF (2/112, 1.79%), NRAS (2/112,
1.79%), Her‑2 (2/112, 1.79%), PIK3CA (6/112, 5.36%) and TP53 (31/112, 27.69%).
There were 27 samples without any somatic mutations in all genes while 24 samples
harboured mutations in two or more genes. A total of 61 samples had one or more
mutations in a single gene. All alterations of 7 genes were presented and the
overall detection rate of NGS and Sanger sequencing was determined to be 51.79%
(58/112) and 37.50% (42/112), respectively (χ2=5.88, P=0.015). Compared with
Sanger sequencing, the total sensitivity and specificity of NGS assays was 95.24%
(40/42) and 77.14% (54/70), respectively. The overall detection rate of NGS and
ddPCR was 45.54% (46/101) and 47.52% (48/101), respectively (χ2=0.000598,
P=0.98). Compared with ddPCR, the overall sensitivity and specificity of NGS
assays was 95.83% (46/48) and 98.11% (52/53), respectively. The findings
indicated that the positive mutation rate of EGFR tested by NGS was significantly
lower than that by Sanger sequencing, but the difference between ddPCR and NGS
was not statistically significant. The high degree of agreement of reportable
variants is proposed in both NGS and ddPCR analysis, suggesting the performance
of NGS assays in routine clinical detection may be useful in determining the
treatment decisions in NSCLC patients.

Ki-67 parameter is a proliferation marker in malignant tumors. The increased
proliferation activity and the decreased prognosis in lung cancer determined us
to investigate different parameters connected to the tumor's aggression, such as 
cellularity, Ki-67 positivity rate, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen
(PCNA). We evaluated the proliferative activity in 62 primary lung tumors by
determining the cell's percentage of Ki-67 and immunoreactive PCNA (using MIB-1
and PCNA monoclonal antibodies), classifying Ki-67 and PCNA immunoreactivity into
three score groups. The results obtained emphasized a linkage between Ki-67 score
with the histological tumor subtype, tumor cellularity and degree of
differentiation and with other proliferation immunohistochemistry (IHC) markers, 
such as p53 cellular tumor antigen. The tumor's cellularity, the Ki-67 positivity
rate and PCNA, together with the clinical stage and the histological
differentiation bring extra pieces of useful information in order to anticipate
the evolution and the prognosis of lung cancer.

Lung tumors represent a major health problem. In early stage NSCLC tumors,
surgical resection is the preferred treatment, but 30-55% of patients will
relapse within 5 years after surgery. Thus, the identification of prognostic
biomarkers in early stage NSCLC patients, especially those which are
therapeutically addressable, is crucial to enhance survival of these patients. We
determined the immunohistochemistry expression of key proteins involved in
tumorigenesis and oncogenic signaling, p53, EGFR, pAKT and pERK, and correlated
their expression level to clinicopathological characteristics and patient
outcome. We found EGFR expression is higher in the squamous cell carcinomas than 
in adenocarcinomas (p=0.043), and that nuclear p53 staining correlated with lower
differentiated squamous tumors (p=0.034). Regarding the prognostic potential of
the expression of these proteins, high pERK levels proved to be an independent
prognostic factor for overall (p<0.001) and progression-free survival (p<0.001)
in adenocarcinoma patients, but not in those from the squamous histology, and
high p53 nuclear levels were identified as independent prognostic factor for
progression-free survival (p=0.031) only in squamous cell carcinoma patients. We 
propose a role as early prognostic biomarkers for pERK protein levels in
adenocarcinoma, and for nuclear p53 levels in squamous cell lung carcinoma. The
determination of these potential biomarkers in the adequate histologic context
may predict the outcome of early stage NSCLC patients, and may offer a
therapeutic opportunity to enhance survival of these patients.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the subtype of lung cancer with the highest
degree of malignancy and the lowest degree of differentiation. The purpose of
this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms of SCLC using
bioinformatics analysis, and to provide new ideas for the early diagnosis and
targeted therapy of SCLC. Microarray data were downloaded from Gene Expression
Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in SCLC were compared with the
normal lung samples and identified. Gene Ontology (GO) function and pathway
analysis of DEGs was performed through the DAVID database. Furthermore,
microarray data was analyzed by using the clustering analysis tool GoMiner.
Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks of DEGs were constructed using the
STRING online database. Protein expression was determined from the Human Protein 
Atlas, and SCLC gene expression was determined using Oncomine. In total, 153 DEGs
were obtained. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that the majority of DEGs
were associated with the cell cycle. CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1 and CDK1 were
identified to contribute to the progression of SCLC through combined use of GO,
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes enrichment analysis and a PPI network.
mRNA and protein expression were also validated in an integrative database. The
present study indicated that the formation of SCLC may be associated with cell
cycle regulation. In addition, the four crucial genes CCNB1, CCNB2, MAD2L1 and
CDK1, which are downstream of p53, may have important roles in the occurrence and
progression of SCLC, and thus may be promising potential biomarkers and
therapeutic targets.

The tumor suppressor gene p53 and its dynamic patterns have caused widespread
attention in the field of cancer research. Serum and glucocorticoid-regulated
kinase 1 (SGK1) with features of serine/threonine kinase activity, which also
contributes to the structural and functional similarities with the AKT family of 
kinases, is a key enzyme in the regulation of immune responses in tumor cells,
and SGK1 was noted to be expressed in close relation to p53 protein levels, and
there exists a negative feedback pathway between intracellular SGK1 and p53.
Noteworthy, SGK1 was detected to play a role in the development of resistance to 
cancer chemotherapy. In this study, we demonstrated that high SGK1 expression had
strong prognostic value for reduced overall survival in NSCLC patients. Detection
of SGK1 collectively was helpful to predict the prognosis of NSCLC. We also
identified the expression level of SGK1 and the p53 pathway including downstream 
apoptotic proteins under the stimulation of γ-radiation and SGK1 inhibitor
GSK650394, which presented a series of dynamic fluctuations. Our results suggest 
that SGK1 dynamics could play an important role in cell signaling, which is
capable of directly influencing NSCLC cellular fate decisions.

BACKGROUND: This study aimmed to evaluate the expression of p53-inducible RR
small subunit 2 homologue (p53R2) in Lung sarcomatoid carcinoma (LSC) and its
association with clinicopathological parameters and prognosis.
METHODS: In this study, clinicopathological factors and prognostic significance
of the expression of p53R2 was investigated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) in 100 
cases of LSC.
RESULTS: The results showed that the expression of p53R2 was significantly
correlated with clinical stage (P<0.05). But there was no statistically
correlation with gender, age, smoking, tumor size, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage, 
therapy and relapse. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that the expression of p53R2,
clinical stage, pT stage, pN stage, pM stage and tumor size were closely related 
to patients' survival, and the analysis also revealed that patients with low
expression of p53R2 had a longer overall survival than that with high expression 
(Mean overall survival: 84.8 months vs. 34.7 months, P<0.05). Further
multivariate analysis indicated that the expression of p53R2 was identified as an
independent prognostic factor in the prediction of the overall survival for
patients with LSC (HR = 3.217, P<0.05).
CONCLUSIONS: The expression of p53R2 was inversely associated with the
proliferation and progression of LSC, and the results indicated that the high
expression of p53R2 was an independent factor for unfavorable prognosis of
patients with LSC.

BACKGROUND: NKX2-1, a key molecule in lung development, is highly expressed in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), particularly in lung adenocarcinoma (ADK),
where it is a diagnostic marker. Studies of the prognostic role of NKX2-1 in
NSCLC have reported contradictory findings. Two microRNAs (miRNAs) have been
associated with NKX2-1: miR-365, which targets NKX2-1; and miR-33a, which is
downstream of NKX2-1. We have examined the effect of NKX2-1, miR-365 and miR-33a 
on survival in a cohort of early-stage NSCLC patients and in sub-groups of
patients classified according to the mutational status of TP53, KRAS, and EGFR.
METHODS: mRNA and miRNA expression was determined using TaqMan assays in 110
early-stage NSCLC patients. TP53, KRAS, and EGFR mutations were assessed by
Sanger sequencing.
RESULTS: NKX2-1 expression was upregulated in never-smokers (P = 0.017), ADK
(P < 0.0001) and patients with wild-type TP53 (P = 0.001). A negative correlation
between NKX2-1 and miR-365 expression was found (ρ = -0.287; P = 0.003) but there
was no correlation between NKX2-1 and miR-33a expression. Overall survival (OS)
was longer in patients with high expression of NKX2-1 than in those with low
expression (80.8 vs 61.2 months (P = 0.035), while a trend towards longer OS was 
observed in patients with low miR-365 levels (P = 0.07). The impact of NKX2-1 on 
OS and DFS was higher in patients with neither TP53 nor KRAS mutations. Higher
expression of NKX2-1 was related to higher OS (77.6 vs 54 months; P = 0.017) and 
DFS (74.6 vs 57.7 months; P = 0.006) compared to low expression. The association 
between NKX2-1 and OS and DFS was strengthened when the analysis was limited to
patients with stage I disease (P = 0.005 and P=0.003 respectively).
CONCLUSIONS: NKX2-1 expression impacts prognosis in early-stage NSCLC patients,
particularly in those with neither TP53 nor KRAS mutations.

BACKGROUND: Epigenetic therapy is a promising popular treatment modality for
various cancers. Histone modification and miRNA should not be underestimated in
lung cancer. This study aimed to investigate whether chidamide, a histone
deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), which inhibits telomerase activity and induces
cell cycle arrest, influences ROS and miRNA production in non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) cells.
METHODS: H1355 and A549 were treated with chidamide. The analysis of DNA content 
was measured by FACSCalibur equipped with a 488 nm laser. H1355 cells were
transfected with miR-129-3p mimic by Lipofectamine2000. Telomerase activity was
performed on the telomeric repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) assay. Detection 
of thymidylate synthase (TS), p21, p53, pRB, and β-actin, were performed by
western blot analysis.
RESULTS: Our data showed that expression of TS, p21, and pRB were altered in the 
presence of chidamide by PCR and western blot. Using BrdU-incorporation analysis,
we found that chidamide induced G1 arrest through the regulation of the TS gene
by miR-129-3p. Chidamide was shown to suppress telomerase activity in the TRAP
assay and reduced the expression of human telomerase reverse transcriptase
(hTERT) by PCR and q-PCR in H1355 and A549 cells. Chidamide increased the
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) by flow cytometry. N-acetyl cysteine 
(NAC), a ROS scavenger, attenuated chidamide-induced telomerase activity
inhibition.
CONCLUSION: Chidamide repressed telomerase activity through ROS accumulation and 
cell cycle arrest by miR-129-3p upregulation in both H1355 and A549 cells. This
is the first study to demonstrate that chidamide induces miR-129-3p upregulation 
and ROS accumulation, leading to cell cycle arrest.

Cellular senescence is characterized by permanent cell cycle arrest, triggered by
a variety of stresses, such as telomerase inhibition, and it is recognized as a
tumor-suppressor mechanism. In recent years, telomerase has become an important
therapeutic target in several cancers; inhibition of telomerase can induce
senescence via the DNA damage response (DDR). Pterostilbene (PT), a dimethyl
ether analog of resveratrol, possesses a variety of biological functions,
including anticancer effects; however, the molecular mechanisms underlying these 
effects are not fully understood. In this study, we investigated the possible
mechanisms of PT-induced senescence through telomerase inhibition in human
non-small cell lung cancer cells and delineated the role of p53 in senescence.
The results indicated that PT-induced senescence is characterized by a flattened 
morphology, positive staining for senescence-associated-β galactosidase activity,
and the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci. Telomerase
activity and protein expression was significantly decreased in H460 (p53 wild
type) cells compared with H1299 (p53 null) cells and p53 knockdown H460 cells
(H460-p53-). A more detailed mechanistic study revealed that PT-induced
senescence partially occurred via a p53-dependent mechanism, triggering
inhibition of telomerase activity and protein expression, and leading to the DDR,
S phase arrest and, finally, cellular senescence. This study is the first to
explore the novel anticancer mechanism of PT senescence induction via the
inhibition of telomerase in lung cancer cells.

WD repeat protein 79 (WDR79) is a member of the WD-repeat protein family
characterized by the presence of a series of WD-repeat domains and is a scaffold 
protein that participates in telomerase assembly, Cajal body formation and DNA
double strand break repair. Although previous studies have revealed that WDR79 is
frequently overexpressed in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and promotes the
proliferation of NSCLC cells, the underlying mechanism responsible for
WDR79-mediated NSCLC proliferation is not fully understood. In this study, we
report a novel molecular function of WDR79 that mediates NSCLC cell proliferation
by controlling the stability of UHRF1. In the nucleus, WDR79 colocalized and
interacted with UHRF1. As a result, overexpression of WDR79 stabilized UHRF1,
whereas ablation of WDR79 decreased the level of UHRF1. Meanwhile, we showed that
WDR79 can protect UHRF1 from poly-ubiquitination-mediated proteolysis, which
facilitated the stabilization of UHRF1. We further demonstrated that WDR79 exerts
a proliferation effect on NSCLC cells by stabilizing UHRF1. These findings reveal
that WDR79 is a novel UHRF1 regulator by maintaining UHRF1 stability, and they
also provide a clue as to how to explore WDR79 for potential therapeutic
application in NSCLC.

Inactivation of the fragile histidine triad (Fhit) gene has been reported in the 
majority of human cancers, particularly in lung cancer. The role of Fhit as a
tumor suppressor gene has been well documented, and restoration of Fhit
expression suppresses tumorigenicity in tumor cell lines and in mouse models by
inducing apoptosis and inhibiting proliferation of tumor cells. Autophagy is a
catabolic pathway, whereby cytoplasmic proteins and organelles are sequestered in
vacuoles and delivered to lysosomes for degradation and recycling. Although
autophagy is necessary for cell survival under stress conditions, recent studies 
have shown that autophagy can also promote cell death. Due to the fact that both 
autophagy induction and Fhit expression are commonly associated with nutrient
starvation, we hypothesized that Fhit expression may be related to autophagy
induction. In the present study, we assessed whether Fhit overexpression by gene 
transfer induces autophagy in Fhit-deficient non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)
cells. The results of our study indicate that Fhit protein induces autophagy in
NSCLC cells, and that this autophagy prevents apoptotic cell death in vivo and in
vitro in a 14-3-3τ protein-dependent manner. To the best of our knowledge, this
is the first report to describe Fhit-induced autophagy. Suppressing autophagy
might be a promising therapeutic option to enhance the efficacy of Fhit gene
therapy in NSCLC.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the major cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide.
Differential diagnosis can be difficult, especially when only small samples are
available. Epigenetic changes are frequently tissue-specific events in
carcinogenesis and hence may serve as diagnostic biomarkers.
MATERIAL AND METHODS: 138 representative formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE)
tissues (116 lung cancer cases and 22 benign controls) were used for targeted DNA
methylation analysis via pyrosequencing of ten literature-derived methylation
markers (APC, CDH1, CDKN2A, EFEMP1, FHIT, L1RE1, MGMT, PTEN, RARB, and RASSF1).
Methylation levels were analyzed with the Classification and Regression Tree
Algorithm (CART), Conditional Interference Trees (ctree) and ROC. Validation was 
performed with additional 27 lung cancer cases and 38 benign controls. TCGA data 
for 282 lung cancer cases was included in the analysis.
RESULTS: CART and ctree analysis identified the combination of L1RE1 and RARB as 
well as L1RE1 and RASSF1 as independent methylation markers with high
discriminative power between tumor and benign tissue (for each combination, 91%
specificity and 100% sensitivity). L1RE1 methylation associated significantly
with tumor type and grade (p<0.001) with highest methylation in the control
group. The opposite was found for RARB (p<0.001). RASSF1 methylation increased
with tumor type and grade (p<0.001) with strongest methylation in neuroendocrine 
tumors (NET).
CONCLUSION: Hypomethylation of L1RE1 is frequent in tumors compared to benign
controls and associates with higher grade, whereas increasing methylation of RARB
is an independent marker for tumors and higher grade. RASSF1 hypermethylation was
frequent in tumors and most prominent in NET making it an auxiliary marker for
separation of NSCLC and NET. L1RE1 in combination with either RARB or RASSF1
could function as biomarkers for separating lung cancer and non-cancerous tissue 
and could be useful for samples of limited size such as biopsies.

BACKGROUND: DNA methylation in sputum has been an attractive candidate biomarker 
for the non-invasive screening and detection of lung cancer.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Databases including PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane library, Web of
Science databases, Chinese Biological Medicine (CBM), Chinese National Knowledge 
Infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang, Vip Databases and Google Scholar were searched to
collect the diagnostic trials on aberrant DNA methylation in the screening and
detection of lung cancer published until 1 December 2016. Indirect comparison
meta-analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the included candidate
genes.
RESULTS: The systematic literature search yielded a total of 33 studies including
a total of 4801 subjects (2238 patients with lung cancer and 2563 controls) and
covering 32 genes. We identified that methylated genes in sputum samples for the 
early screening and auxiliary detection of lung cancer yielded an overall
sensitivity of 0.46 (0.41-0.50) and specificity of 0.83 (0.80-0.86). Combined
indirect comparisons identified the superior gene of SOX17 (sensitivity: 0.84,
specificity: 0.88), CDO1 (sensitivity: 0.78, specificity: 0.67), ZFP42
(sensitivity: 0.87, specificity: 0.63) and TAC1 (sensitivity: 0.86, specificity: 
0.75).
CONCLUSIONS: The present meta-analysis demonstrates that methylated SOX17, CDO1, 
ZFP42, TAC1, FAM19A4, FHIT, MGMT, p16, and RASSF1A are potential superior
biomarkers for the screening and auxiliary detection of lung cancer.

FHIT is a tumor suppressor gene that is frequently silenced in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and also in preneoplastic lesions. Promoter hypermethylation 
was previously observed in NSCLC, and its epigenetic silencing, observed on mRNA 
or protein level, was proposed to predict NSCLC outcome. In the present study we 
evaluated the relationship between FHIT expression on mRNA level and promoter
methylation, or immunoexpression level. The aim of this study was to analyze the 
usefulness of FHIT as early differentiating biomarker in NSCLC patients. Lung
tissue specimens were obtained from 59 patients with diagnosed NSCLC (SCC=34,
AC=20, LCC=5). FHIT promoter methylation was assessed in methylation-specific
PCR. Relative expression analysis of FHIT was performed in real-time PCR (qPCR)
and protein immunoexpression by ELISA assay. Significant differences in FHIT
expression between NSCLC histopathological groups (SCC, AC, LCC) were observed
(p=0.000009), with the lowest level in SCC. FHIT expression was significantly
higher (p=0.034) in men vs. women. Methylated FHIT alleles were present both in
NSCLC and control specimens. Mean MI value was higher in control tissue vs.
neoplasm, and in men vs. women and it increased with patient age. Significant
increase in MI level was observed in N0 group vs. N1 and N2, according to the TNM
staging (p=0.0073). Differences in FHIT expression levels between AC, LCC and SCC
indicated the usefulness of this gene as a diagnostic marker for NSCLC subtype
differentiation. FHIT promoter hypermethylation both in cancer and control tissue
indicated the presence of epigenetic alterations in early stage of NSCLC
development. Differences in gene promoter methylation between cancer patients
with and without node infiltration might be considered as a prognostic marker.
Significantly lower FHIT protein immunoexpression was revealed in the group with 
long and intense history of smoking assessed as PYs (PY<40 vs. PY≥40, p=0.01).
These results suggest the need of further study on FHIT as a potential biomarker.

The aim of this study was to determine the incidence and role of c-erbB-2
overexpression as a predictive/prognostic marker in small-cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC). We performed a retrospective study on subjects with a biopsy-proven
diagnosis of SCLC. A chart review for demographic and clinical data was performed
on patients with SCLC diagnosed between 1998 and 2004. c-erbB-2 overexpression
was evaluated using immunohistochemistry performed on archival paraffin-embedded 
specimens. Sixty-seven patients with SCLC were identified (6 females, 61 males;
median age- 56.5 yr, range-34-75) all of whom had adequate tissue specimens
available for c-erB-2 testing. Of the 67 specimens, 12 (17.9%) showed c-erbB-2
overexpression. Seventy-five of the cases were positive for c-erbB-2, had
extensive disease. The median overall survival of patients with SCLC whose tumors
were positive and negative for c-erbB-2 were 8 +/- 0.9 months (95%CI 6.3-9.7) and
11 +/- 1.5 months (95%CI 8.0-14.0), respectively. c-erbB-2 overexpression
detected using immunohistochemistry is observed in 17.9% of patients with SCLC
and has statistically significant prognostic value. Our findings suggest that
c-erbB-2 may be a potential target for site-specific immunotherapy in SCLC.
Considering one technique examined, further molecular investigation is needed to 
confirm these preliminary findings.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cannot be efficiently controlled using existing
chemotherapy and radiotherapy approaches, indicating the need for new therapeutic
strategies. Although ABT-737, a B-cell lymphoma-2 (BCL-2) inhibitor, exerts
anticancer effects against BCL-2-expressing SCLC, monotherapy with ABT-737 is
associated with limited clinical activity because of the development of
resistance and toxicity. Here, we examined whether combination therapy with
ABT-737 and heat shock protein 90 (HSP90) inhibitor NVP-AUY922 exerted
synergistic anticancer effects on SCLC. We found that the combination of ABT-737 
and NVP-AUY922 synergistically induced the apoptosis of BCL-2-expressing SCLC
cells. NVP-AUY922 downregulated the expression of AKT and ERK, which activate
MCL-1 to induce resistance against ABT-737. The synergistic effect was also
partly due to blocking NF-κB activation, which induces anti-apoptosis protein
expressions. However, interestingly, targeting BCL-2 and MCL-1 or BCL2 and NF-κB 
did not induce the cytotoxicity. In conclusion, our study showed that combination
of BCL2 inhibitor with HSP90 inhibitor increased activity in in vitro and in vivo
study in only BCL-2 expressing SCLC compared to either single BCL2 inhibitor or
HSP inhibitor. The enhanced activity might be led by blocking several apoptotic
pathways simultaneously rather than a specific pathway.

BACKGROUND: Phytochemical naphtho[1,2-b] furan-4,5‑dione (NFD) presenting in
Avicennia marina exert anti-cancer effects, but little is known regarding about
DNA damage-mediated apoptosis in non-small-cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC).
PURPOSE: To examine whether NFD-induced apoptosis of NSCLC cells is correlated
with the induction of DNA damage, and to investigate its underlying mechanism.
STUDY DESIGN: The anti-proliferative effects of NFD were assessed by MTS Assay
Kit FACS assay, and in vivo nude mice xenograft assay. The DNA damage related
proteins, the Bcl-2 family and pro-apoptotic factors were examined by
immunofluorescence assay, q-PCR, and western blotting. The activity of NF-κB p65 
in nuclear extracts was detected using a colorimetric DNA-binding ELISA assay.
The inhibitory activity of topoisomerase II (TOPO II) was evaluated by molecular 
docking and TOPO II catalytic assay.
RESULTS: NFD exerted selective cytotoxicity against NSCLC H1299, H1437 and A549
cells rather than normal lung-embryonated cells MRC-5. Remarkably, we found that 
NFD activated the hull marker and modulator of DNA damage repairs such as γ-H2AX,
ATM, ATR, CHK1, and CHK2 probably caused by the accumulation of intracellular
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inhibition of TOPO II activity. Furthermore,
the suppression of transcription factor NF-κB by NFD resulted in significantly
decreased levels of pro-survival proteins including Bcl-2 family Bcl-2, Bcl-xL
and Mcl-1 and the endogenous inhibitors of apoptosis XIAP and survivin in H1299
cells. Moreover, the nude mice xenograft assay further validated the suppression 
of H1299 growth by NFD, which is the first report for evaluating the anti-cancer 
effect of NFD in vivo.
CONCLUSION: These findings provide a novel mechanism indicating the inhibition of
TOPO II activity and NF-κB signaling by NFD, leading to DNA damage and apoptosis 
of NSCLC tumor cells.

Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is a clinically aggressive cancer with very poor
prognosis. Amplification of MYC family genes and overexpression of Bcl-2 protein 
are common in SCLC, and they are likely therapeutic targets for SCLC. Previous
clinical study showed that single agent targeting Bcl-2 with ABT-263 was of
limited efficacy in SCLC. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time that 
co-targeting of N-Myc and Bcl-2 resulted in marked synergistic antitumor effects 
in MYCN-amplified SCLC. We found that MYCN-amplified SCLC cells were highly
sensitive to a Bromodomain and Extra-Terminal domain (BET) inhibitor JQ1, which
was able to inhibit N-Myc protein expression. The inhibition of N-Myc by JQ1
induced the expression of Bim, and thereby sensitizing MYCN-amplified SCLC cells 
to ABT-263. The knockdown on Bim by siRNA reduced this JQ1/ABT-263 induced cell
death. ABT-263 and JQ1 co-treatment in MYCN-amplified SCLC cells markedly
disrupted Bim/Bcl-2 interaction, and prevented Bim's interaction with Mcl-1.
Importantly, this JQ1/ABT-263 co-targeting substantially inhibited the growth of 
MYCN-amplified SCLC xenografts in vivo. Our study demonstrates a new JQ-1/ABT-263
co-targeting strategy that can be employed for MYCN-amplified SCLC with high
efficacy.

PURPOSE: DNA damage-induced cell death is a major effector mechanism of
radiotherapy. Aberrant expression of anti-apoptotic BCL-2 family proteins is
frequently observed in lung cancers. Against this background, we studied
radioresistance mediated by BCL-2 family proteins at the mechanistic level and
its potential as target for radiochemotherapy.
METHODS: Lung cancer models stably expressing BCL-xL or MCL-1 were irradiated to 
study cell death, clonogenic survival, and DNA repair kinetics in vitro, and
growth suppression of established tumors in vivo. Additionally, endogenous BCL-xL
and MCL-1 were targeted by shRNA or pharmacologic agents prior to irradiation.
RESULTS: Radiation exposure induced apoptosis at negligible levels. Yet,
anti-apoptotic BCL-xL and MCL-1 expression conferred short-term and long-term
radioresistance in vitro and in vivo. Radioresistance correlated with
pertubations in homologous recombination repair and repair of DNA double-strand
breaks by error-prone, alternative end-joining. Notably, genetic or pharmacologic
targeting of BCL-xL or MCL-1 effectively sensitized lung cancer cells to
radiotherapy.
CONCLUSIONS: In addition to directly suppressing apoptosis, BCL-2 family proteins
confer long-term survival benefits to irradiated cancer cells associated with
utilization of error-prone repair pathways. Targeting BCL-xL and MCL-1 is an
attractive strategy for improving lung cancer radiotherapy.

BACKGROUND: Excision repair cross-complementary 1 (ERCC1) overexpression in lung 
cancer cells is strongly correlated with its resistance to platinum-based
chemotherapy. Overexpression of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) reverts
platinum-induced cancer cell death.
PURPOSE: Curcumin has been reported to enhance antitumor properties through the
suppression of TP and ERCC1 in non-small cell lung carcinoma cells (NSCLC).
Nevertheless, whether two other curcuminoids, demethoxycurcumin (DMC) and
bisdemethoxycurcumin (BDMC) from Curcuma longa demonstrate antitumor activity
like that of curcumin remain unknown.
METHODS: MTT assay was conducted to determine the cell cytotoxicity. Western
blotting was used to determine the protein expressions. Docking is the virtual
screening of a database of compounds and predicting the strongest binders based
on various scoring functions. BIOVIA Discovery Studio 4.5 (D.S. 4.5) were used
for docking.
RESULTS: Firstly, when compared with curcumin and BDMC, DMC exhibited the most
potent cytotoxic effect on NSCLC, most importantly, MRC-5, a lung fetal
fibroblast, was insensitive to DMC (under 30 µM). Secondly, DMC alone
significantly inhibited on-target cisplatin (CDDP) resistance protein, ERCC1, via
PI3K-Akt-snail pathways, and TP protein expression in A549 cells. Thirdly, DMC
treatment markedly increased post-target CDDP resistance pathway including Bax
and cytochrome c. DMC significantly decreased Bcl-2 protein expressions. Finally,
MTT assay indicated that DMC significantly increased CDDP-induced cytotoxicity
and was confirmed with an increased Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, indicating upregulation of
caspase-3.
CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that enhancement of the cytotoxicity to CDDP by
coadminstration with DMC was mediated by down-regulation of the expression of TP 
and ERCC1, regulated by PI3K-Akt-Snail pathway inactivation.

BACKGROUND: Lung cancer is the leading cause of global cancer-related mortality. 
Dioscin-6'-O-acetate (DA), a novel natural steroidal saponin, was firstly
isolated from the rhizomes of Dioscorea althaeoides R. Knuth. Until now, there
were no studies on its pharmacological activities.
PURPOSE: Here, we investigated the growth inhibitory effect and explored the
underlying molecular mechanisms of DA against lung cancer cells.
METHODS/STUDY DESIGNS: NSCLC H460, H1299, H520 cells and SCLC H446 cells were
treated with DA. To display the cytotoxic effects and possible mechanism of DA on
these cells, MTT assay, flow cytometry and western blot analysis were carried
out.
RESULTS: Our results showed that DA exerted strong anti-proliferative activity
against lung cancer cells in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. Flow
cytometry demonstrated DA induced the cell cycle arrest at S-phase (NCI-H460,
NCI-H1299, NCI-H520) or G1-phase (NCI-H446), caused cellular apoptosis,
generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and loss of mitochondrial membrane
potential. Western blotting analysis showed DA treatment increased the levels of 
caspase 3, 8, 9, Bax, p21, p53, phosphorylated JNK and p38 MAPK and markedly
decreased the expression of Bcl-2, p-ERK, p-PI3K, p-AKT and NF-κB. Blockade of
caspases with Z-VAD-FMK converted apoptosis-related proteins. Suppression of p53 
with pifithrin-α (PFT) attenuated cell cycle-related protein. Inhibition of ROS
with N-acetyl-cysteine (NAC) adjusted apoptosis-related proteins and
phosphorylated MAPK and PI3K, as well as NF-κB.
CONCLUSION: Overall, our study indicated that DA suppressed lung cancer cells
proliferation via inducing cell-cycle arrest and enhancing caspase-dependent
apoptosis, at least partly, through ROS-mediated PI3K/AKT, MAPK and NF-κB
signaling pathways.

BACKGROUND: Scutellarin (SCU), a flavonoid isolated from Erigeron breviscapus
(Vant.) Hand.-Mazz., increases autophagy and apoptosis in the adenocarcinoma A549
cell line, which is resistant to cisplatin. However, whether SCU alone has
antitumor activity against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is unknown.
METHODS: Cell Counting Kit-8, flow cytometry, colony formation, Hoechst 33258
staining, and Western blot analyses were used to examine the proliferation and
apoptosis of A549 cells treated with SCU and the possible molecular mechanisms.
RESULTS: The cell viability assay indicated that SCU markedly suppressed the
proliferation of A549 cells in concentration and time-dependent manners. SCU
caused significant G0/G1 phase arrest and apoptosis, as evidenced by flow
cytometric analyses, Hoechst 33258 staining, and Western blot analyses of cyclin 
D1, cyclin E, BCL-2, cleaved-caspase-3, and BAX. Furthermore, SCU treatment
reduced the level of pan-AKT, phosphorylated (p)-mTOR, mTOR, BCL-XL, STAT3, and
p-STAT3, and increased the level of 4EBP1.
CONCLUSIONS: SCU can suppress proliferation and promote apoptosis in A549 cells
through AKT/mTOR/4EBP1 and STAT3 pathways. This suggests that SCU may be
developed into a promising antitumor agent for treating NSCLC.

Src homology region 2 (SH2)-containing protein tyrosine phosphatase 2 (SHP2) is
ubiquitously expressed in cytoplasmic localization, which in turn confers tumor
malignancy and poor prognosis in various human cancers. YAP1 interacts with SHP2 
to promote translocation of SHP2 to nucleus, which consequently promotes Wnt
target activation. However, the oncogenic role of the nuclear localization of
SHP2 in human cancers remains unclear. We hypothesized that nuclear SHP2
localization, in combination with nuclear YAP1 expression, could be associated
with poor overall survival (OS) and relapse free survival (RFS) due to an
increase in cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA expression following activation of
Wnt/ß-catenin signaling. Immunohistochemical analysis of SHP2 and YAP1 protein
expression in 102 tumors resected from patients with NSCLC revealed that nuclear 
SHP2 expression was well correlated with nuclear YAP1 expression (P < 0.001).
Evaluation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc mRNA levels by the real-time reverse-phase
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) revealed that patients with high cyclin D1 and
high c-Myc mRNA expressing tumors more commonly showed high nuclear YAP1 and high
nuclear SHP2 (high/high) rather than the high/low, low/high, or low/low
combinations (P < 0.001 for cyclin D1 and c-Myc). Kaplan-Meier and Cox-regression
models showed OS and RFS to be poorer in patients in the high/high subgroup than 
in the low/low subgroup (OS: HR = 2.85, 95% CI, 1.52-5.35, P = 0.001; RFS:
HR = 2.55, 95% CI, 1.37-4.72, P = 0.003). No prognostic significance was observed
for the other two subgroups (low/high and high/low) when compared to the low/low 
subgroup in this study population. Therefore, we suggest that the prognostic
value of SHP2 could reflect the nuclear localization of SHP2 and its interaction 
with nuclear YAP1, which led to subsequent upregulation of cyclin D1 and c-Myc
mRNA expression via activation of the Wnt/ß-catenin signaling pathway.

Drug resistance is a major problem in the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer
(NSCLC). In this study, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway
analysis was performed to identify the differentially expressed genes in
Adriamycin (ADR)-resistant NSCLC A549/ADR cells compared with parental A549
cells. Among the tested phytochemicals, nobiletin (NBT) is able to overcome the
ADR resistance of A549/ADR cells. NBT treatment decreased the expression of a
neuroblastoma-derived MYC (MYCN) and multidrug resistance-associated protein 1
(MRP1) as well as downregulating Akt, GSK3β, and β-catenin. Consistent with these
results, NBT treatment resulted in the accumulation of intracellular ADR. A
combination index (CI) assay confirmed the synergistic effect of combined
treatment with NBT and ADR in reducing the viability of A549/ADR cells (CI =
0.152). Combined treatment with NBT and ADR enhanced apoptosis in A549/ADR cells,
as evidenced by increased caspase-3 activation, poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase
(PARP) cleavage, and sub-G1 population compared to treatment with ADR alone. In
vivo experiments using a mouse xenograft model revealed that combination therapy 
with NBT and ADR significantly reduced tumor volume by 84.15%. These data suggest
that NBT can sensitize ADR-induced cytotoxicity against A549/ADR cells by
inhibiting MRP1 expression, indicating that NBT could serve as an effective
adjuvant agent for ADR-based chemotherapy in lung cancer.

Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) is among the most malignant lung cancers
worldwide, lacking biomarkers for diagnostic and targets for treatment. In this
study, we observed that miR-140-3p was expressed at low levels both in SqCLC cell
lines and patient samples, while overexpression of miR-140-3p dramatically
reduced the cell proliferation and invasion in SqCLC cells and Patient derived
xenograft (PDX) models. Our further investigation indicated miR-140-3p negatively
affected the tumorigenesis of SqCLC by down-regulating the expression of BRD9, an
oncogene in SqCLC. Inhibition of BRD9 repressed SqCLC tumorigenesis by regulating
c-myc expression. Meanwhile, BRD9 expression is up-regulated and negatively
correlated with miR-140-3p in clinical samples; a meta-analysis of survival data 
indicates that SqCLC patients with high levels of BRD9 in their tumors have a
worse prognosis. Collectively, our study suggests the prognostic and therapeutic 
roles of miR-140-3p and BRD9 axis in squamous cell lung cancer.

LncRNAs play significant roles in various cell biological processes. In the
present study, we demonstrated that PICART1 expression was down-regulated in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues. Lower expression level of PICART1 was
associated with advanced stage. In addition, PICART1 expression was
down-regulated in NSCLC cell lines. Overexpression of PICART1 inhibited NSCLC
cell growth and induced cell cycle arrest at G2/M phase. Elevated expression of
PICART1 suppressed NSCLC cell colony formation and cell invasion. Ectopic
expression of PICART1 promoted the expression of epithelial marker E-cadherin
while suppressed the mesenchymal marker expression such as N-cadherin and Snail
and Vimentin. Furthermore, PICART1 overexpression suppressed AKT phosphorylation 
and c-Myc expression while inhibited the p21 expression in NSCLC cell. AKT
phosphorylation was involved in PICART1 mediated suppression of cell growth and
invasion. These results suggested that overexpression of PICART1 suppressed cell 
growth and invasion partly through regulating AKT signaling pathway in NSCLC.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most common and malignant
carcinoma worldwide, and the incidence and mortality are increasing rapidly.
Immunotherapy targeting programmed death 1/programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1)
signaling has shown prominent clinical effects in treating NSCLC; however, a poor
understanding of the associated regulating molecular mechanisms of PD-L1 has
become one of the biggest obstacles for further improving efficacy. Bridging
integrator-1 (BIN1) can regulate numerous cancer-related molecules to exert
multiple tumor-suppressing effects by either interacting or not interacting with 
c-MYC. In the present study, we observed that there exists a negative correlation
between the expression of PD-L1 and BIN1 in NSCLC tissues. The expression levels 
of BIN1 and PD-L1 were significantly related to the tumor, lymph node and
metastasis grade (TNM) stage, invasion range and lymph node metastasis.
Simultaneously, for NSCLC patients, the expression statuses of BIN1 and PD-L1
might be independent prognostic factors. Furthermore, the expression of
tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes was positively associated with BIN1 expression and
negatively related to PD-L1 expression in NSCLC tissues. Importantly, we showed
that PD-L1 was under the control of BIN1. In addition, the overexpression of BIN1
could inhibit the c-MYC and epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR)-dependent
PD-L1 expression and reverse the suppressive immuno-microenvironment in vivo.
Taken together, our findings indicated that BIN1 restoration in NSCLC could

Fragile histidine triad (FHIT) loss by the two-hit mechanism of loss of
heterozygosity and promoter hypermethylation commonly occurrs in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC) and may confer cisplatin resistance in NSCLC cells. However, 
the underlying mechanisms of FHIT loss in cisplatin resistance and the response
to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in NSCLC patients have not yet been reported. In 
the present study, inhibition concentration of 50% cell viability induced by
cisplatin (IC50) and soft agar growth and invasion capability were increased and 
decreased in FHIT-knockdown and -overexpressing cells, respectively.
Mechanistically, Slug transcription is upregulated by AKT/NF-κB activation due to
FHIT loss and, in turn, Slug suppresses PUMA expression; this decrease of PUMA by
FHIT loss is responsible for cisplatin resistance. In addition, cisplatin
resistance due to FHIT loss can be conquered by AKT inhibitor-perifosine in
xenograft tumors. Among NSCLC patients, low FHIT, high p-AKT, high Slug and low
PUMA were correlated with shorter overall survival, relapse-free survival and
poorer response to cisplatin-based chemotherapy. Therefore, the AKT inhibitor
perifosine might potentially overcome the resistance to cisplatin-based
chemotherapy in NSCLC patients with low-FHIT tumors, and consequently improve the
outcome.

Metastasis is the principal cause of cancer death and occurs through multiple,
complex processes that involve the concerted action of many genes. A number of
studies have indicated that the Fragile Histidine Triad (FHIT) gene product,
FHIT, functions as a tumor suppressor in a variety of common human cancers.
Although there are suggestions of a role for FHIT loss in progression of various 
cancers, a role for such loss in metastasis has not been defined. Here, via in
vivo and in vitro assays, we reveal that the enforced expression of FHIT
significantly suppresses metastasis, accompanied by inhibition of the
epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), a process involved in metastasis through
coordinate modulation of EMT-related genes. Specifically, miR-30c, a
FHIT-upregulated microRNA, contributes to FHIT function in suppression of EMT and
metastasis by directly targeting metastasis genes Metadherin (MTDH),
High-mobility group AT-hook 2 (HMGA2), and the mesenchymal markers, Vimentin
(VIM) and Fibronectin (FN1), in human lung cancer. Finally, we demonstrate that
the expression pattern of FHIT and miR-30c is inversely correlated with that of
MTDH and HMGA2 in normal tissue, non-metastatic and metastatic tumors, serving as
a potential biomarker for metastasis in lung cancer.

Aberrant DNA methylation can be a potential genetic mechanism in non-small cell
lung cancer (NSCLC). However, inconsistent findings existed among the recent
association studies between cigarette smoking and gene methylation in lung
cancer. The purpose of our meta-analysis was to evaluate the role of gene
methylation in the smoking behavior of NSCLC patients. A total of 116 genes were 
obtained from 97 eligible publications in the current meta-analyses. Our results 
showed that 7 hypermethylated genes (including CDKN2A, RASSF1, MGMT, RARB, DAPK, 
WIF1 and FHIT) were significantly associated with the smoking behavior in NSCLC
patients. The further population-based subgroup meta-analyses showed that the
CDKN2A hypermethylation was significantly associated with cigarette smoking in
Japanese, Chinese and Americans. In contrast, a significant association of RARB
hypermethylation and smoking behavior was only detected in Chinese but not in
Japanese. The genes with altered DNA methylation were likely to be potentially
useful biomarkers in the early diagnosis of NSCLC.

High-risk human papillomavirus (HPV)16/18 infection in the development of lung
cancer has previously been identified, and fragile histidine triad (FHIT) loss
and p53 mutation are frequently observed in the disease. However, the association
between these factors has not been well studied. The present study aimed to
further investigate the significance of HPV infection, FHIT loss and p53
mutations in the development of lung cancer and their possible associations. DNA 
was extracted from paraffin-embedded specimens from 88 cases of squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC), 56 of adenocarcinoma (AC), 36 of small cell lung carcinoma
(SCLC) and 110 non-cancer control cases of lung neoplasms. The prevalence of HPV 
infection was determined by polymerase chain reaction analysis, and FHIT loss and
p53 mutations were detected by immunohistochemistry. The χ2, Fisher's exact and
Pearson correlation tests were applied for statistical analysis. The results of
the present study demonstrated that HPVL1 (the major capsid protein of HPV),
HPV16 and HPV18 infection were more prevalent in the lung cancer samples compared
with the non-cancer controls (all P<0.001). FHIT loss occurred more frequently in
the lung cancer samples (44.44%) compared with the non-cancer controls (7.25%)
(P<0.001). FHIT loss in the HPVL1-positive group was significantly increased
compared with the HPVL1-negative group in the lung cancer cases and the
non-cancer controls (P<0.05). In the lung cancer cases, the p53 mutation rates in
the HPVL1- and HPV16/18-positive groups were significantly increased compared
with the HPVL1- and HPV16/18-negative groups (P<0.05). In the 180 lung cancer
cases, the coexistence rate of FHIT loss and a history of smoking was 38.33%
(69/180; Pearson contingency coefficient of r=0.318; P<0.001). FHIT loss and p53 
mutation exhibited a synergistic effect on HPV-associated lung cancer (Pearson
contingency coefficient r=0.357, P<0.001). The present study demonstrated that
FHIT loss may be important in the occurrence of lung cancer, particularly in lung
SCCs. FHIT loss may therefore be used as an early indicator for lung cancer,
particularly for patients with a history of smoking. HPV infection in lung
tumorigenesis may, at least in part, be mediated through FHIT loss. FHIT loss and
p53 mutation may coordinate together in the development of HPV-associated lung
cancer, and accelerate the occurrence and development of lung cancer.

Emerging evidence indicates that FHIT is a candidate tumor suppressor in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, the correlation between FHIT
hypermethylation and clinicopathological characteristics of NSCLC remains
unclear. Thus, we conducted a meta-analysis to quantitatively evaluate the
effects of FHIT hypermethylation on the incidence of NSCLC and
clinicopathological characteristics. Final analysis of 1717 NSCLC patients from
16 eligible studies was performed. FHIT hypermethylation was found to be
significantly higher in NSCLC than in normal lung tissue, the pooled OR from 8
studies including 735 NSCLC and 708 normal lung tissue, OR = 5.45, 95% CI =
2.15-13.79, p = 0.0003. FHIT hypermethylation was also correlated with sex
status, smoking status, as well as pathological types. We did not find that FHIT 
hypermethylation was correlated with the differentiated types or clinical stages 
in NSCLC patients. However, patients with FHIT hypermethylation had a lower
survival rate than those without, HR = 1.73, 95% CI = 1.10-2.71, p = 0.02. The
results of this meta-analysis suggest that FHIT hypermethylation is associated
with an increased risk and worsen survival in NSCLC patients. FHIT
hypermethylation, which induces the inactivation of FHIT gene, plays an important
role in the carcinogenesis and clinical outcome and may serve as a potential drug
target of NSCLC.

Tumour angiogenesis has been recently recognised as one of the most important
prognostic factors in lung cancer. Although a variety of angiogenic factors have 
been identified, the angiogenesis process remains poorly understood. Bcl-2,
c-erbB-2 and p53 are well-known oncogenes involved in non-small-cell lung cancer 
pathogenesis. A direct correlation of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) and of
vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) with intratumoural angiogenesis has
been reported. In the present study we investigated the possible regulatory role 
of bcl-2, c-erB-2 proteins in angiogenesis and in VEGF and TP expression in
non-small-cell lung cancer. Two hundred sixteen specimens from T1,2-N0,1 staged
patients treated with surgery alone were immunohistochemically examined. Bcl-2
and c-erbB-2 were significantly inversely related to each other (P = 0.04) and
both were inversely associated with microvessel density (P < 0.02). High TP and
VEGF reactivity was statistically related to loss of bcl-2 expression (P < 0.01).
A significant co-expression of c-erbB-2 with TP was noted (P = 0.01). However, TP
expression was related to high angiogenesis only in cases with absence of c-erB-2
expression (P < 0.0001). c-erbB-2 expression in poorly vascularised tumours was
linked with poor outcome (P = 0.03). The present study provides strong evidence
that the bcl-2 gene has a suppressive function over genes involved in both
angiogenesis (VEGF and TP) and cell migration (c-erbB-2) in NSCLC. TP and
c-erbB-2 proteins are significantly, and often simultaneously, expressed in bcl-2
negative cases. However, expression of the c-erbB-2 abolishes the TP-related
angiogenic activity. Whether this is a result of a direct activity of the
c-erbB-2 protein or a consequence of a c-erbB-2-related immune response remains
to be further investigated.

Objective: Rho GTPase-activating protein 30 (ARHGAP30), a member of the Rho
GTPase-activating proteins (Rho GAPs) family, plays an important role in the
regulation of cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion.
Materials and methods: mRNA and protein expression was assessed by quantitative
real-time PCR and Western blotting, respectively. Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) and
Transwell assays were conducted to detect cell proliferation, migration, and
invasion.
Results: ARHGAP30 expression was downregulated in specimens and cell lines of
lung cancer in comparison to non-cancerous specimens and normal bronchial
epithelial cell lines, respectively. Moreover, in vitro experiments demonstrated 
that ARHGAP30 overexpression impeded the proliferative, migratory, and invasive
abilities of lung cancer cells. Moreover, bioinformatics analysis with The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA) lung cancer dataset showed a negative association between
ARHGAP30 expression and the Wnt signaling pathway. Enforced expression of
ARHGAP30 decreased the mRNA and protein levels of β-catenin, c-Myc, matrix
metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) and MMP-9. Besides, the β-catenin inhibitor XAV939
blocked the enhanced cell growth, migration, and invasion caused by ARHGAP30
knockdown. Thus, the Wnt/β-catenin pathway mediated the functions of ARHGAP30 in 
lung cancer cells.
Conclusion: ARHGAP30 acts as a tumor suppressor in lung cancer by suppressing
Wnt/β-catenin signaling.

Effect of RIF1 on response of non-small-cell lung cancer patients to
platinum-based chemotherapy by regulating MYC signaling pathway.

Laboratory of Pharmacogenetics, Changsha 410078, P. R. China.

Platinum-based chemotherapy is used as first-line therapy for advanced
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, there is no effective indicator to
predict whether the patient would be chemo-resistant or sensitive to the therapy.
In addition, it is urgent to elucidate the mechanisms of cisplatin resistance.
RIF1 plays important roles in DNA replication regulation and DNA repair pathway. 
However, the role of RIF1 in NSCLC progression and chemotherapy response is still
unknown. In this study, we found that RIF1 expression was correlated with the
response of NSCLC patients to platinum-based chemotherapy (n=89, P=0.002). Among 
patients who have been treated with platinum chemo-therapy, those with high
levels of RIF1 expression had significantly shorter survival than those with low 
RIF1 expression (P<0.05). RIF1 knockdown increased sensitivity to cisplatin in
NSCLC patients both in vitro and in vivo. Moreover, RIF1 knockdown induced G0/G1 
phase arrest and increased cisplatin-induced apoptosis and DNA damage. Further
investigation showed that RIF1 regulated the expression of MYC and MYC downstream
targets, including the cell cycle and double-stranded break (DSB) repair genes
which might mediate the effect of RIF1 on cellular response to cisplatin.
Overexpression of MYC could reverse the inhibition of MYC targets by RIF1
knockdown. Taken together, these data revealed that RIF1 played an important role
in regulating MYC and MYC-activated genes, which in turn contributes to cellular 
response to cisplatin and NSCLC patients' response to platinum-based
chemotherapy. RIF1 might serve as a novel biomarker for predicting platinum-based
chemo-sensitivity and the prognosis of NSCLC patients, so as to guide the
chemotherapy regimen adjustment for individual patient with NSCLC and improve
their clinical outcomes.

Curcumin inhibits the growth via Wnt/β-catenin pathway in non-small-cell lung
cancer cells.

OBJECTIVE: In recent decades, the death rate from lung cancer appears to be an
increasing yearly trend, particularly for non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Curcumin is a yellow pigment found in turmeric rhizomes, reported to exhibit
various anti-inflammatory, anti-angiogenic, anti-proliferative, and antioxidant
properties. Many reports have suggested that curcumin could induce apoptosis in
malignant cells, and therefore, has great potential in tumor treatment. However, 
little is known about the effect of curcumin on NSCLC or its associated mode of
action. Therefore, in this study, we explored curcumin's effect on NSCLC and
investigated its associated mechanism.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: The non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line A549 was 
cultured and subjected to MTT and clonogenic survival assays to assess cell
proliferation. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels were measured using a
Fluostar Omega Spectrofluorimeter. Superoxide dismutase (SOD) and γ-glutamyl
cysteine synthetase (γ-GCS) activity in A549 cells were both determined by a
commercial determination kit. Expression levels of p-GSK3β (Ser9), c-Myc, cyclin 
D1, β-catenin α-tubulin, and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were
analyzed by Western blot.
RESULTS: Results of the MTT and clonogenic survival assay indicated that curcumin
reduced A549 proliferation. ROS levels and SOD and γ-GCS activities were
detected. Curcumin decreased intracellular ROS levels and increased SOD and γ-GCS
activity. Meanwhile, the ROS inhibitor N-Acetylcysteine (NAC) reversed the
decrease in ROS levels and the increase in SOD and γ-GCS activity. These results 
indicate that oxidative stress is involved in the curcumin-induced reduction of
A549 viability. Curcumin also strongly inhibited β-catenin and p-GSK3β (Ser9)
protein expression, as well as the expression of downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc. 
Similarly, NAC reversed the inhibition of β-catenin and p-GSK3β (Ser9) protein
expression, as well as the expression of downstream cyclin D1 and c-Myc.
CONCLUSIONS: We showed that curcumin inhibits NSCLC proliferation via the
Wnt/β-catenin pathway.

Long noncoding RNAs have been reported to be essential regulators in several
human diseases, including tumorigenesis. A recent report revealed that FLVCR1-AS1
promotes the progression of hepatocellular carcinoma. However, whether FLVCR1-AS1
is involved in lung cancer remains unclear. In this study, we found that the
expression of FLVCR1-AS1 was increased in lung cancer tissues according to The
Cancer Genome Atlas database. Similarly, FLVCR1-AS1 was significantly upregulated
in lung cancer cell lines. Knockdown of FLVCR1-AS1 dramatically reduced the cell 
proliferation, migration, and invasion of SPCA1 and A549. Mechanistically, we
found that the expression levels of CTNNB1, SOX4, CCND1, CCND2, c-MYC, as well as
nucleus β-catenin were decreased in lung cancer cells after FLVCR1-AS1 silencing.
Thus, FLVCR1-AS1 positively regulates the activation of the Wnt/β-catenin
pathway. Overexpression of CTNNB1 reversed the effect of FLVCR1-AS1 knockdown on 
A549 cells. In sum, FLVCR1-AS1 silencing inhibited the proliferation, migration, 
and invasion of lung cancer cells by inhibiting the activity of the Wnt/β-catenin
signaling pathway.

Lung adenocarcinomas are characterized by mutations in the receptor tyrosine
kinase (RTK)/Ras/Raf pathway, with up to 75% of cases containing mutations in
known driver genes. However, the driver alterations in the remaining cases are
yet to be determined. Recent exome sequencing analysis has identified SOS1,
encoding a guanine nucleotide exchange factor, as significantly mutated in lung
adenocarcinomas lacking canonical oncogenic RTK/Ras/Raf pathway mutations. Here, 
we demonstrate that ectopic expression of lung adenocarcinoma-derived mutants of 
SOS1 induces anchorage-independent cell growth in vitro and tumor formation in
vivo. Biochemical experiments suggest that these mutations lead to overactivation
of the Ras pathway, which can be suppressed by mutations that disrupt either the 
Ras-GEF or putative Rac-GEF activity of SOS1. Transcriptional profiling reveals
that the expression of mutant SOS1 leads to the upregulation of MYC target genes 
and genes associated with Ras transformation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that an
AML cancer cell line harboring a lung adenocarcinoma-associated mutant SOS1 is
dependent on SOS1 for survival and is also sensitive to MEK inhibition. Our work 
provides experimental evidence for the role of SOS1 as an oncogene and suggests a
possible therapeutic strategy to target SOS1-mutated cancers. IMPLICATIONS: This 
study demonstrates that SOS1 mutations found in lung adenocarcinoma are oncogenic
and that MEK inhibition may be a therapeutic avenue for the treatment of
SOS1-mutant cancers.

BACKGROUND: Brain metastasis (BM) is associated with poor prognosis, recurrence, 
and death in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase 1 (LPCAT1) has been reported to be
involved in the progression, metastasis and recurrence of malignancies. However, 
the potential role of LPCAT1 in NSCLC remains poorly understood. This study was
aimed to identify genes involved in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) brain metastasis, 
and look into the role of LPCAT1 in LUAD progression.
METHODS: We used integrative genomic analysis to identify genes involved in lung 
adenocarcinomas. LPCAT1 expression was evaluated in tumor tissues from LUAD
patients and LUAD cell lines. The role of LPCAT1 was subsequently investigated
both in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism underlying the involvement of LPCAT1 in 
LUAD progression was explored with the activator of PI3K/AKT pathway. RNA
sequencing was performed to confirm the involvement of LPCAT1 and associated
pathway in LUAD brain metastasis.
RESULTS: LPCAT1 was up-regulated in LUAD tissues and cell lines. shRNA-mediated
depletion of LPCAT1 not only abrogated cell proliferation, migration and invasion
in vitro, but also arrested tumor growth and brain metastases in vivo. Notably,
LPCAT1 at least partially influenced LUAD progression through PI3K/AKT signal
pathway by targeting MYC transcription. Moreover, expression of LPCAT1 was higher
in tissues of LUAD patients with BM than those without BM as revealed by IHC
staining, RNA-Sequencing and qPCR analysis. Finally, elevated LPCAT1 expression
in patients with lung adenocarcinomas was associated with a poor clinical
outcome.
CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that LPCAT1 works as a regulator of cell
metastasis and may serve as a novel therapeutic target for BM in lung
adenocarcinoma.

The NAD+-dependent deacetylase SIRT1 can be oncogenic or tumor suppressive
depending on the tissue. Little is known about the role of SIRT1 in non-small
cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), one of the deadliest cancers, that is frequently
associated with mutated K-RAS Therefore, we investigated the effect of SIRT1 on
K-RAS-driven lung carcinogenesis. We report that SIRT1 protein levels are
downregulated by oncogenic K-RAS in a MEK and PI3K-dependent manner in mouse
embryo fibroblasts (MEFs), and in human lung adenocarcinoma cell lines.
Furthermore, Sirt1 overexpression in mice delays the appearance of
K-RasG12V-driven lung adenocarcinomas, reducing the number and size of carcinomas
at the time of death and extending survival. Consistently, lower levels of SIRT1 
are associated with worse prognosis in human NSCLCs. Mechanistically, analysis of
mouse Sirt1-Tg pneumocytes, isolated shortly after K-RasG12V activation, reveals 
that Sirt1 overexpression alters pathways involved in tumor development:
proliferation, apoptosis, or extracellular matrix organization. Our work
demonstrates a tumor suppressive role of SIRT1 in the development of K-RAS-driven
lung adenocarcinomas in mice and humans, suggesting that the SIRT1-K-RAS axis
could be a therapeutic target for NSCLCs.

Dexamethasone (Dex), co-administered to lung adenocarcinoma patients with
pemetrexed chemotherapy, protects against pemetrexed cytotoxicity by inducing
reversible G1 arrest, reflected by the effect of Dex on FLT-PET images of patient
tumors. However, perioperative Dex treatment increases survival but the mechanism
is unknown. In cells with glucocorticoid receptor-α (GR) expression corresponding
to higher clinical tumor levels, Dex-induced growth arrest was followed by marked
cell expansion, beta-galactosidase expression and Ki67 negativity, despite
variable p53 and K-RAS status. Dex induced a transient early surge in p21Cip1.
However, a progressive, irreversible loss of clonogenic growth, whose time of
onset was dependent on GR level and Dex dose, was independent of p21Cip1and
caused by gradual accumulation of p27Kip1 due to transcriptional activation of
p27Kip1 by Dex. This effect was independent of canonical pathways of senescence
or p27Kip1 regulation. The in vitro observations were reflected by growth
suppression and P27Kip1 induction in GR-overexpressing tumor xenografts compared 
with isogenic low-GR tumors. Extended Dex treatment induces irreversible cell
cycle blockade and a senescence phenotype through chronic activation of the
p27Kip1 gene in GR overexpressing lung tumor cell populations and hence could
improve outcome of surgery/pemetrexed chemotherapy and sensitize tumors to
immunotherapy.

University, Guangzhou City, Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China.

BACKGROUND: p14ARF, a tumor suppressor protein, encoded by the p16 tumor
suppressor gene, has been reported to be associated with the clinicopathological 
features of lung cancer. However, the evaluated outcomes were inconsistent and
remained inconclusive. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis to clarify the
significance of p14ARF expression in lung cancer pathogenesis.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: Electronic databases, PubMed, Web of Knowledge, Embase,
and CNKI, were retrieved to collect relevant articles with inclusion and
exclusion criteria. Using Stata 12.0 software, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and
odds ratios (ORs) were calculated.
RESULTS: A total of 15 eligible case-control studies that evaluated the
relationship between p14ARF expression and lung cancer were included in the
meta-analysis. The results demonstrated that there were significant associations 
between p14ARF expression and the risk of non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC),
lung adenocarcinoma, and lung squamous carcinoma (for NSCLC, OR =11.02, 95% CI
=5.30-22.92; for lung adenocarcinoma, OR =7.28, 95% CI =3.92-13.50; and for lung 
squamous carcinoma, OR =14.40, 95% CI =2.83-73.24). In the stratified analysis
based on race, significant associations between p14ARF expression and lung cancer
risk were found in Chinese population and Caucasians (for Chinese population, OR 
= 7.02, 95% CI =4.48-11.00 and for Caucasians, OR =4.19, 95% CI =1.42-12.38).
Furthermore, the expression of p14ARF was significantly associated with the
TNM-stage of lung cancer in Chinese population (OR =2.07, 95% CI =1.38-3.10).
CONCLUSION: p14ARF expression was significantly associated with the risk of lung 
cancer. In addition, the data of the meta-analysis showed that there was a
significant correlation between p14ARF expression and the TNM-stage of lung
cancer in Chinese population.

Purpose: Previous genomic studies have identified two mutually exclusive
molecular subtypes of large-cell neuroendocrine carcinoma (LCNEC): the RB1
mutated (mostly comutated with TP53) and the RB1 wild-type groups. We assessed
whether these subtypes have a predictive value on chemotherapy
outcome.Experimental Design: Clinical data and tumor specimens were
retrospectively obtained from the Netherlands Cancer Registry and Pathology
Registry. Panel-consensus pathology revision confirmed the diagnosis of LCNEC in 
148 of 232 cases. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for TP53, RB1, STK11, and
KEAP1 genes, as well as IHC for RB1 and P16 was performed on 79 and 109 cases,
respectively, and correlated with overall survival (OS) and progression-free
survival (PFS), stratifying for non-small cell lung cancer type chemotherapy
including platinum + gemcitabine or taxanes (NSCLC-GEM/TAX) and
platinum-etoposide (SCLC-PE).Results:RB1 mutation and protein loss were detected 
in 47% (n = 37) and 72% (n = 78) of the cases, respectively. Patients with RB1
wild-type LCNEC treated with NSCLC-GEM/TAX had a significantly longer OS [9.6;
95% confidence interval (CI), 7.7-11.6 months] than those treated with SCLC-PE
[5.8 (5.5-6.1); P = 0.026]. Similar results were obtained for patients expressing
RB1 in their tumors (P = 0.001). RB1 staining or P16 loss showed similar results.
The same outcome for chemotherapy treatment was observed in LCNEC tumors
harboring an RB1 mutation or lost RB1 protein.Conclusions: Patients with LCNEC
tumors that carry a wild-type RB1 gene or express the RB1 protein do better with 
NSCLC-GEM/TAX treatment than with SCLC-PE chemotherapy. However, no difference
was observed for RB1 mutated or with lost protein expression. Clin Cancer Res;

Background: Anthracosis of the lung occurs due to the deposition of carbon and
silica in the mucosa and submucosa, manifested as black lesions. The association 
of anthracosis with lung cancer has remained to be clearly elucidated The current
study aimed to assess the P16, CDH1 and LUNX genes expression level to evaluate
the association of anthracotic lesions in the lungs with the occurrence of
non-small cell lung cancer. Methods: Forty biopsy samples were taken from the
center and 40 from the margins of black anthracotic lesions in the lungs; RNA was
extracted from the samples and cDNA was synthesized. Real-time
reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was performed to assess 
the expression of P16, CDH1 and LUNX genes. All steps were performed in
triplicate. Results: A significant reduction in P16 gene expression was noted at 
the center compared to the margins of the lesions (P<0.001). expression level of 
CDH1 at the center of lesions was significantly lower than margins (P<0.001).
However, LUNX gene had significantly higher expressionlevel at the center
compared to margins (P<0.001). Conclusion: Decreased expression of P16 and CDH1
and increased expression of LUNX tumor genes were noted at the center of
anthracotic lesions. Significant increase in expression of LUNX gene in NSCLC
indicates an association between anthracosis and NSCLC, according to which,
anthracotic patients may carry a high risk for NSCLC.

Pulmonary small cell carcinoma (SCLC) is usually diagnosed in small biopsy or
cytological specimens based on cytomorphology; however in ambiguous cases
diagnosis requires additional support by immunohistochemistry. While TP53 and RB1
alterations with secondary overexpression of p16 are mainstay events in SCLC
pathogenesis, diagnostic value of p16-positivity in the diagnosis of SCLC has not
yet been fully investigated. We examined the expression of p16, CD56,
synaptophysin (SYP), chromogranin A and thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) in 
a series of pulmonary and extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas, pulmonary
carcinoids and non-small cell lung carcinomas, and compared diagnostic
performance of these markers in the diagnosis of SCLC. P16 was positive in 95 of 
101 SCLCs, and displayed highest diagnostic sensitivity of ~94%. Composite
biomarkers CD56+p16+TTF1 and CD56+p16+SYP were both able to detect correctly all 
SCLC cases. Importantly, three (~3%) SCLC cases completely negative for all
conventional markers displayed diffuse positivity for p16. CD56 and p16
demonstrated highest concordance between paired small biopsy and cytology
specimens. 50% of squamous cell carcinomas, ~41% of adenocarcinoma/NSCLC-favour
adenocarcinoma cases, and ~93% of extrapulmonary small cell carcinomas also
showed p16-positivity. Combination of CD56, p16 and TTF1 produced diagnostic
classifier that outperformed best single marker CD56 in differential diagnosis
between SCLC and NSCLC. In conclusion, in the appropriate morphological context
p16 represents a useful supplementary marker for diagnosis of SCLC, even in cases
where only cytological material is available.

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between expression of tumor suppressor
gene p16 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues and clinicopathological
parameters,to further study on DNA methyltransferase inhibitors 5-nitrogen
impurity-2'-deoxycytidine (5-Aza-CdR) in human lung cancer cell line A549 in
regulating the expression of p16.
METHODS: The expression of p16 protein in 76 cases of NSCLC tissues and normal
tissue adjacent to carcinoma were detect by immunohistochemical SP method and the
differences of p16 protein expression were analyzed. p16 gene promoter region of 
DNA methylation status were detect by MSP method in 5-Aza-CdR processing A549
cells,the expression of p16 in A549 lung cancer cell and effect of 5-Aza-CdR were
detect by Western blot method.
RESULTS: 32 cases (42.11%) of p16 protein expression was positive,significantly
lower than that of the normal tissue adjacent to carcinoma (positive expression
in 59 cases,77.63%) in 76 cases of NSCLC tissues; There were statistically
significant differences (P<0.05) in the positive expression rates of p16 in NSCLC
tissues with different pathological tissue grading,tumor differentiation
degree,clinical TNM stage and lymph node metastasis. In A549 cells,p16 protein
expression and non-methylated products were both in low expression states. After 
treated with 5-Aza-CdR,the expression of p16 protein and its non-methylated
products were up-regulated,with the increase of 5-Aza-CdR concentration.
CONCLUSION: The low expression of p16 in NSCLC tissues with squamous cell
carcinomas,low differentiation,lymph node metastasis and phase Ⅲ-Ⅳ,which may
prompt the deactivation and cause further progression of NSCLC,5-Aza-CdR could
induce the expression of p16 protein and non-methylated products in A549 cells.

Membrane-Bound CD40L Promotes Senescence and Initiates Senescence-Associated
Secretory Phenotype via NF-κB Activation in Lung Adenocarcinoma.

Xu W, Li Y, Yuan WW, Yin Y, Song WW, Wang Y, Huang QQ, Zhao WH, Wu JQ.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: Cellular senescence acts as a barrier against tumorigenesis. The
CD40L transgene, expressed in some tumor cells, not only becomes visible to
antigen-presenting cells but also actively catalyzes its own termination. Here,
we evaluated the effect of a membrane-bound mutant form of human CD40L (CD40L-M) 
on senescence and the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) in
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
METHODS: CD40 expression levels in the NSCLC cell lines A549/TR, A549/DDP and
H460 were examined by flow cytometry. Senescent cells and tissues were identified
via SA-β-gal activity. Cell proliferation was visualized by EdU labeling.
qRT-PCR, Western blotting, and immunofluorescence staining were conducted to
assess mRNA and protein expression levels of CD40L, γ-H2A.X, p65, p-p65, IκBα,
p53, p21 and p16. Cytokines secreted from transfected cells were tested by ELISA 
and cell migration assay. Capsid tyrosine-modified rAAV5-CD40L-M was packaged and
carried out in vivo.
RESULTS: Overexpression of CD40L-M promoted senescence, inhibited proliferation, 
increased DNA damage-associated γ-H2A.X, and initiated the SASP in CD40-positive 
NSCLC cells. NF-κB signaling was activated by CD40L-M overexpression in these
cells. Knockdown of NF-κB partially overcame senescence and failed to induce
SASP. Furthermore, increased p53 and p21 protein levels induced by CD40L-M were
also reduced following NF-κB suppression.
CONCLUSIONS: These data showed that the membrane-bound CD40L mutant may promote
cellular senescence and initiate the SASP of NSCLC cells in an NF-κB-dependent
manner. Therefore, CD40L-M-induced senescence may be a potential approach to
protect against lung adenocarcinoma.

BACKGROUND: Squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC) is a distinct histologic subtype of
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Although the discovery of driver mutations
and their targeted drugs has remarkably improved the treatment outcomes for lung 
adenocarcinoma, currently no such molecular target is clinically available for
SqCLC. The CDKN2A locus at 9p21 encodes two alternatively spliced proteins,
p16INK4a (p16) and p14ARF (p14), which function as cell cycle inhibitors. The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project revealed that CDKN2A is inactivated in 72% of 
SqCLC cases. In addition, it was found that CDKN2A mutations are significantly
more common in SqCLC than in adenocarcinoma. Down-regulation of p16 and p14 by
CDKN2A gene inactivation leads to activation of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs), 
thereby permitting constitutive phosphorylation of Rb and subsequent cell cycle
progression. Here, we hypothesized that CDK inhibition may serve as an attractive
strategy for the treatment of CDKN2A-defective SqCLC.
METHODS: We investigated whether the CDK inhibitors flavopiridol and dinaciclib
may exhibit antitumor activity in CDKN2A-defective SqCLC cells compared to
control cells. The cytotoxic effect of the CDK inhibitors was evaluated using
cell viability assays, and the induction of apoptosis was assessed using TUNEL
assays and Western blot analyses. Finally, anti-tumor effects of the CDK
inhibitors on xenografted cells were investigated in vivo.
RESULTS: We found that flavopiridol and dinaciclib induced cytotoxicity by
enhancing apoptosis in CDKN2A-defective SqCLC cells, and that epithelial to
mesenchymal transition (EMT) decreased and autophagy increased during this
process. In addition, we found that autophagy had a cytoprotective role.
CONCLUSION: Our data suggest a potential role of CDK inhibitors in managing
CDKN2A-defective SqCLC.

Pulmonary small cell carcinoma (SCLC) can be usually diagnosed based on the
morphological evaluation of routine histological or cytological preparations.
However, immunohistochemistry may be also necessary in problematic cases.
Insulinoma-associated 1 (INSM1) has recently been reported as a highly sensitive 
and specific marker that displays positivity in ~90%-100% of poorly
differentiated pulmonary neuroendocrine tumors. We compared diagnostic
performance of INSM1 and previously reported composite marker CD56 + p16 +
thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF1) in the diagnosis of SCLC in small biopsy
specimens and cytoblocks. The composite marker CD56 + p16 + TTF1 correctly
classified 100% of SCLC cases, and its sensitivity was significantly higher than 
the sensitivity of INSM1. Among 100 SCLC cases, CD56, TTF1, and p16 each
individually classified more specimens correctly than INSM1 (CD56: 84%, TTF1:
89%, p16: 95%, INSM1: 81%); the difference was statistically significant only for
p16. INSM1 showed the lowest classification agreement between paired biopsy and
cytoblock specimens (κ = 0.182), whereas CD56 and p16 displayed perfect agreement
(κ = 1) and TTF1 showed moderate agreement (κ = 0.4). Although INSM1 is
reportedly the most specific marker of SCLC, its sensitivity is not superior to
p16 or composite marker CD56 + TTF1 + p16. Based on this study, we propose the
following algorithm, which, in the appropriate clinical and histological context,
may be useful in establishing the correct diagnosis of SCLC: First, INSM1
detection is performed, and if the result is negative, CD56 is added, followed
successively by p16 and TTF1 if all previously applied markers are negative. This
approach should detect most, if not all, SCLC cases, while successively trading
specificity for sensitivity.

It has been reported that p16 protein is overexpressed in many types of solid
cancer and its aberrant expression may trigger the immune response, leading to
the secretion of anti-p16 antibodies. Here, we developed an in-house ELISA with
three p16-derived linear peptide antigens to examine plasma anti-p16 antibody
levels in patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Blood samples were
taken from 200 control subjects and 211 patients with NSCLC prior to anticancer
therapy. A Mann-Whitney U test demonstrated that plasma anti-p16a IgG levels were
significantly higher in NSCLC patients than in control subjects (Z = -11.14,
P < 0.001). However, neither plasma anti-p16b nor plasma anti-p16c IgG levels
showed significant differences in patients with NSCLC as compared to control
subjects. Moreover, further analysis indicated that anti-p16a IgG levels
increased with tumor stages, and patients with late stage NSCLC, namely group IV,
had the highest IgG levels among four subgroups. Receiver operating
characteristic analysis revealed that the anti-p16a IgG assay had a sensitivity
of 32.7% against a specificity of 95.0% in group IV, while Kaplan-Meier survival 
analysis revealed no significant difference in overall survival between patients 
with high anti-p16a IgG levels and those with low anti-p16a IgG levels (χ2
 = 0.24, P = 0.63). In conclusion, anti-p16a IgG may be suitable for use as a
prognostic biomarker for NSCLC.

Context: Despite sputum cytology being accepted as a simple and noninvasive
diagnostic method for lung cancer, the clinical usefulness of sputum for
evaluation of prognosis is yet to be explored. Validation of some of the markers 
in sputum for prognosis prediction will be highly useful for selective therapy.
Aims: This study was aimed to evaluate a reliable panel of immunocytochemical
markers for their significance to predict survival.
Materials and Methods: We have analyzed the expression of p53, p16, galectin-3,
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) proteins in sputum samples processed 
in a mucolytic agent/cellblock and compared the same with that of the
corresponding tissue samples.
Results: Overexpression of p16 and EGFR was found to have a better survival
benefit, whereas positive p53 and galectin-3 expressions had shorter period of
survival. Expression patterns of all these four proteins were more or less
similar in smears, cellblocks of sputum, and tissue samples except for slight
changes in staining intensity which was not found to be statistically
significant. No significant difference was found in the association of these
proteins with survival pattern between sputum and tissue samples.
Conclusion: This is the first report of immunocytochemistry of a panel of markers
on cells exfoliated in sputum samples which suggests that analysis of
immunocytochemical markers in sputum samples can be attempted as a cost-effective
and reliable predictor of prognosis and survival. Accumulation of mutated p53,
overexpression of galectin-3, and lower expression of p16 and EGFR proteins were 
found to predict poor prognosis for lung cancer.

Dysregulation of the cell cycle is a key indicator of tumors, including lung
cancer. Recently, the study of cell cycle inhibitors has made great progress in
relation to lung cancer. However, the question of what kinds of patients can use 
cell cycle inhibitors has plagued us. Therefore, seeking an accurate and
convenient marker for the abnormal cell cycle in lung cancer is very important.
In the present research, we showed that lncRNA HOTAIR is an optimal indicator of 
cell cycle dysregulation in lung cancer. In the present study, we investigated
HOTAIR-specific expression in lung primary tumor samples by analyzing the TCGA
public database and 67 pairs of patients' tissues collected from our department. 
Through the TCGA public database KEGG analysis, HOTAIR correlates with the cell
cycle pathway. We identified that HOTAIR and its 2 segments, HOTAIR3' and
HOTAIR5', promote the cell cycle passing through the restriction point during
G1-S phase by regulating the Rb-E2F pathway and influence non-small-cell lung
cancer cell proliferation, migration and invasion through epithelial-mesenchymal 
transition (EMT) and the β-catenin pathway in vitro and vivo. Finally, we showed 
that the high expression of HOTAIR was associated with resistance to gefitinib
through the dysregulated cell cycle. In conclusion, HOTAIR could be an ideal
indicator of cell cycle dysregulation and guide the use of cell cycle inhibitors.

A T790M secondary mutation in epidermal-growth-factor receptor (EGFR) is the most
well-established EGFR-tyrosine-kinase-inhibitor (TKI) resistance marker in
non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The current methods to rapidly and accurately
detect T790M in clinical practice are not satisfactory because of several
obstacles, including the unavailability of tumor-tissue rebiopsies and the low
DNA copy number of T790M in circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Here, we develop
library-aliquot-based droplet digital PCR (LAB-ddPCR) to increase detection
sensitivity without affecting accuracy. This new LAB-ddPCR method is performed
using aliquots of the ctDNA precapture next-generation-sequencing (NGS) library, 
in which the isolated ctDNA was amplified and enriched. We show that the
LAB-ddPCR can precisely distinguish between T790M wild-type and mutation alleles 
without introducing extra false-positive signals. In a cohort of 70 post-TKI
NSCLC patients, the LAB-ddPCR identified 41 T790M-positive cases (sensitivity
58.57%), but ddPCR only detected T790M in 27 cases (sensitivity 38.57%). Taking
the ARMS-PCR result from matched tumor rebiopsies into consideration, the
LAB-ddPCR method is better than ddPCR. In conclusion, the LAB-ddPCR ctDNA test
offers a feasible and flexible option for the rapid and accurate detection of the
T790M secondary mutation, which is helpful in dynamically monitoring drug
response and disease progression throughout the therapeutic regimen.

Purpose: Gene rearrangements involving NTRK1/2/3 can generate fusion oncoproteins
containing the kinase domains of TRKA/B/C, respectively. These fusions are rare
in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with frequency previously estimated to be 
<1%. Inhibition of TRK signaling has led to dramatic responses across tumor types
with NTRK fusions. Despite the potential benefit of identifying these fusions,
the clinicopathologic features of NTRK fusion-positive NSCLCs are not well
characterized.
Methods: We compiled a database of NSCLC cases harboring NTRK fusions. We
characterized the clinical, molecular, and histologic features of these cases
with central review of histology.
Results: We identified 11 NSCLC cases harboring NTRK gene fusions verified by
next-generation sequencing (NGS) and with available clinical and pathologic data,
forming the study cohort. Fusions involved NTRK1 (7 cases) and NTRK3 (4 cases),
with 5 and 2 distinct fusion partners, respectively. Cohort patients were 55%
male, with a median age at diagnosis of 47.6 years (range 25.3-86.0) and a median
pack year history of 0 (range 0-58). 73% of patients had metastatic disease at
diagnosis. No concurrent alterations in KRAS, EGFR, ALK, ROS1, or other known
oncogenic drivers were identified. Nine cases were adenocarcinoma, including 2
invasive mucinous adenocarcinomas and 1 adenocarcinoma with neuroendocrine
features; one was squamous cell carcinoma; and one was neuroendocrine carcinoma. 
By collating data on 4872 consecutively screened NSCLC cases from unique
patients, we estimate a frequency of NTRK fusions in NSCLC of 0.23% (95% CI
0.11-0.40).
Conclusion: NTRK fusions occur in NSCLCs across genders, ages, smoking histories,
and histologies. Given the potent clinical activity of TRK inhibitors, we
advocate that all NSCLCs be screened for NTRK fusions using a multiplexed
NGS-based fusion assay.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related morbidity and mortality
worldwide. Interaction of nascent or established lung tumour cells with various
cytokines and infiltrating immune cells has been implicated in lung cancer
pathogenesis. In this study, we systematically analysed immunoreactivity for
IL-17A, IL-17E and IL-17F and their relevant receptors in the lung sections from 
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and normal control. Immunoreactivity for
IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA and IL- 17RC, but not IL-17RB was significantly elevated 
in NSCLC compared with controls, while IL-17E was reduced. The median numbers of 
infiltrating lymphocytes and neutrophils and global macrophage (CD68)
immunoreactivity of phagocytes were also elevated in NSCLC compared with control 
tissue sections. Furthermore, correlation between the expression of IL-17A and
its receptors IL-17RA and IL- 17RC varied according to NSCLC histopathological
type. These data suggest that IL-17A, E, F and their receptors IL-17RA, RB, RC
may be involved in the pathogenesis of NSCLC. Further understanding of the
relationship between the IL-17/IL-17R axis and the tumour inflammatory
microenvironment may reveal new therapeutic targets.

Prediction of lung cancer metastasis relies on post-resection assessment of tumor
histology, which is a severe limitation since only a minority of lung cancer
patients are diagnosed with resectable disease. Therefore, characterization of
metastasis-predicting biomarkers in pre-resection small biopsy specimens is
urgently needed. Here we report a biomarker consisting of the phosphorylation of 
the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) on serine 249 combined with elevated p39
expression. This biomarker correlates with epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition
traits in non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) cells. Immunohistochemistry
staining of NSCLC tumor microarrays showed that strong phospho-Rb S249 staining
positively correlated with tumor grade specifically in the squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) subtype. Strong immunoreactivity for p39 positively correlated
with tumor stage, lymph node invasion, and distant metastases, also in SCC.
Linear regression analyses showed that the combined scoring for phospho-Rb S249, 
p39 and E-cadherin in SCC is even more accurate at predicting tumor staging,
relative to each score individually. We propose that combined
immunohistochemistry staining of NSCLC samples for Rb phosphorylation on S249,
p39, and E-cadherin protein expression could aid in the assessment of tumor
staging and metastatic potential when tested in small primary tumor biopsies. The
intense staining for phospho-Rb S249 that we observed in high grade SCC could
also aid in the precise sub-classification of poorly differentiated SCCs.

Comment in
    Curr Oncol. 2019 Feb;26(1):e119-e120.

Background: Inhibition of the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (alk) oncogenic driver
in advanced non-small-cell lung carcinoma (nsclc) improves survival. In 2015,
Canadian thoracic oncology specialists published a consensus guideline about the 
identification and treatment of ALK-positive patients, recommending use of the
alk inhibitor crizotinib in the first line. New scientific literature warrants a 
consensus update.
Methods: Clinical trials of alk inhibitor were reviewed to assess benefits,
risks, and implications relative to current Canadian guidance in patients with
ALK-positive nsclc.
Results: Randomized phase iii trials have demonstrated clinical benefit for
single-agent alectinib and ceritinib used in treatment-naïve patients and as
second-line therapy after crizotinib. Phase ii trials have demonstrated activity 
for single-agent brigatinib and lorlatinib in further lines of therapy. Improved 
responses in brain metastases were observed for all second- and
next/third-generation alk tyrosine kinase inhibitors in patients progressing on
crizotinib. Canadian recommendations are therefore revised as follows:■ Patients 
with advanced nonsquamous nsclc have to be tested for the presence of an ALK
rearrangement.■ Treatment-naïve patients with ALK-positive disease should
initially be offered single-agent alectinib or ceritinib, or both sequentially.■ 
Crizotinib-refractory patients should be treated with single-agent alectinib or
ceritinib, or both sequentially.■ Further treatments could include single-agent
brigatinib or lorlatinib, or both sequentially.■ Patients progressing on alk
tyrosine kinase inhibitors should be considered for pemetrexed-based
chemotherapy.■ Other systemic therapies should be exhausted before immunotherapy 
is considered.
Summary: Multiple lines of alk inhibition are now recommended for patients with
advanced nsclc with an ALK rearrangement.

G1/S phase transition. Palbociclib in combination with anti-hormonal therapy
brings significant benefit to breast cancer patients. In this study, novel
combination approaches and underlying molecular/cellular mechanisms for
palbociclib were explored in squamous cell lung cancer (SqCLC), the second most
common subtype of non-small cell lung cancer. While approximate 20% lung patients
benefit from immunotherapy, most SqCLC patients who receive platinum-doublet
chemotherapy as first-line treatment, which often includes a taxane, are still in
need of more effective combination therapies. Our results demonstrated enhanced
cytotoxicity and anti-tumor effect with palbociclib plus taxanes at clinically
achievable doses in multiple SqCLC models with diverse cancer genetic
backgrounds. Comprehensive gene expression analysis revealed a sustained
disruption of pRB-E2F signaling by combination that was accompanied with enhanced
regulation of pleiotropic biological effects. These included several novel
mechanisms such as abrogation of G2/M and mitotic spindle assembly checkpoints,
as well as impaired induction of hypoxia-inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF-1α). The
decrease in HIF-1α modulated a couple key angiogenic and anti-angiogenic factors,
resulting in an enhanced anti-angiogenic effect. This preclinical work suggests a
new therapeutic opportunity for palbociclib in lung and other cancers currently
treated with taxane based chemotherapy as standard of care.

Areca nut chewing habits are associated with several oral manifestations like
leukoplakia, submucous fibrosis and oral squamous cell carcinoma. Although
numerous evidence on areca toxicity is known but the mechanistic pathway of
disease causation is to be studied. Aqueous areca nut extract treated A549 cells 
showed reduced cell viability by 48 h with IC50 value of 0.50%. The toxic nature 
of areca nut induced the production of reactive oxygen species with decreased
anti-oxidant glutathione S transferase levels lead to altered redox homeostasis. 
PCR studies showed decreased mRNA levels of Jun and Fos AP-1 subunits on extract 
treatment by 48 h. The protein levels of PCNA, CDK4, RB, p53, c-Jun and c-Fos
were found to be downregulated with upregulated CDK inhibitor p21 on extract
treatment as compared to control. Results of FACS analysis further confirm G1/S
phase cell cycle arrest on areca nut extract exposure. The regulation of
downstream AP-1 subunits by MAPKs was studied by using specific inhibitors of
ERK, JNK and p38 along with areca nut extract. Results showed the redox
activation of MAP kinases down regulated the mRNA levels of AP-1 subunits in
aqueous areca nut extract treated cells. Hence the present study aids in
elucidating the role of MAP kinases in regulating the AP-1 subunits and their
implications on target genes that are involved regulation of various cellular
processes. Further, it would help in understanding the mechanistic aspects of the
diseased state which may facilitate in designing of new therapeutic modalities
that could help in cancer management.

The retinoblastoma gene (RB1) encodes the retinoblastoma (RB) pocket protein that
plays an important role in cell cycle progression. Here we determine the
frequency and prognostic significance of RB1 mutation in non small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC), restricting inclusion to Stage III and IV patients with linked
genomic and clinical data. The primary outcome was median overall survival (OS). 
We identified RB1 mutation in 8.2% of NSCLC patients. The median OS for wild-type
(wt) RB1 was 28.3 months vs 8.3 months for mutant RB1 (Hazard Ratio = 2.59,
P = 0.002). Of special interest, RB1 mutation also correlated with lack of
response to immunotherapy. Our study focused on RB1 mutation in locally advanced 
and advanced non small cell lung cancer to better facilitate comparisons with
small cell lung cancer (SCLC). In our SCLC cohort, RB1 mutation was identified in
75% of patients and wt RB1 was associated with significantly shorter OS
(P = 0.002). The different outcomes of RB1 mutation observed among lung cancer
subtypes suggest a more complicated mechanism than simple regulation of cell
cycle or response to chemotherapy.

The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) phenotype, whereby mature epithelial 
cells undergo phenotype transition and differentiate into motile, invasive cells,
has been indicated in tumor metastasis. The melatonin hormone secreted by the
pineal gland has an antioxidant effect and protects cells against carcinogenic
substances that reduce tumor progression. However, the effects of melatonin in
EMT and lung cancer metastasis are largely unknown. We found that melatonin
down-regulated EMT by inhibiting Twist/Twist1 (twist family bHLH transcription
factor 1) expression. This effect was mediated by MT1 receptor, PLC, p38/ERK and 
β-catenin signaling cascades. Twist expression was positively correlated with
tumor stage and negatively correlated with MT1 expression in lung cancer
specimens. Furthermore, melatonin inhibited EMT marker expression and lung cancer
metastasis to liver in vivo Finally, melatonin shows promise in the treatment of 
lung cancer metastasis and deserves further study.

BACKGROUND: ING5 is the last member of the Inhibitor of Growth (ING) candidate
tumor suppressor family that has been implicated in multiple cellular functions, 
including cell cycle regulation, apoptosis, and chromatin remodeling. Our
previous study showed that ING5 overexpression inhibits lung cancer
aggressiveness and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), with unknown
mechanisms.
METHODS: Western blotting was used to detect total and phosphorylated levels of
β-catenin and EMT-related proteins. Immunofluorescent staining was used to
observe E-cadherin expression. Proliferation and colony formation, wound healing,
and Transwell migration and invasion assays were performed to study the
proliferative and invasive abilities of cancer cells.
RESULTS: ING5 overexpression promotes phosphorylation of β-catenin at Ser33/37,
leading to a decreased β-catenin protein level. Small hairpin RNA-mediated ING5
knockdown significantly increased the β-catenin level and inhibited
phosphorylation of β-catenin S33/37. Treatment with the WNT/β-catenin inhibitor
XAV939 inhibited ING5-knockdown promoted proliferation, colony formation,
migration, and invasion of lung cancer A549 cells, with increased phosphorylation
of β-catenin S33/37 and a decreased β-catenin level. XAV939 also impaired
ING5-knockdown-induced EMT, as indicated by upregulated expression of the EMT
marker E-cadherin, an epithelial marker; and decreased expression of N-cadherin, 
a mesenchymal marker, and EMT-related transcription factors, including Snail,
Slug, Twist, and Smad3. Furthermore, XAV939 could inhibit the activation of both 
IL-6/STAT3 and PI3K/Akt signaling pathways.
CONCLUSION: ING5 inhibits lung cancer invasion and EMT by inhibiting the
WNT/β-catenin pathway.

Type III epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been previously associated
with increased cell migration, invasion, metastasis, and therefore cancer
aggressiveness. This reversible process is associated with an important gene
expression reprogramming mainly due to epigenetic plasticity. Nevertheless, most 
of the studies describing the central role of epigenetic modifications during EMT
were performed in a single-cell model and using only one mode of EMT induction.
In our study, we studied the overall modulations of gene expression and
epigenetic modifications in four different EMT-induced cell models issued from
different tissues and using different inducers of EMT. Pangenomic analysis
(transcriptome and ChIP-sequencing) validated our hypothesis that gene expression
reprogramming during EMT is largely regulated by epigenetic modifications of a
wide range of genes. Indeed, our results confirmed that each EMT model is unique 
and can be associated with a specific transcriptome profile and epigenetic
program. However, we could select some genes or pathways that are similarly
regulated in the different models and that could therefore be used as a common
signature of all EMT models and become new biomarkers of the EMT phenotype. As an
example, we can cite the regulation of gene-coding proteins involved in the
degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM), which are highly induced in all
EMT models. Based on our investigations and results, we identified ADAM19 as a
new biomarker of in vitro and in vivo EMT and we validated this biological new
marker in a cohort of non-small lung carcinomas.

BACKGROUND: Programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression on lung cancer cells is 
a prognostic marker and a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy.
However, previous clinical trials have suggested that other programmed cell death
1 ligands, including programmed death-ligand 2 (PD-L2), might have clinical
impacts. This study aimed to analyze the prognostic significance of PD-L2
expression in lung adenocarcinoma patients.
METHODS: The study included 433 patients who underwent surgical resection for
lung adenocarcinoma between 2003 and 2012 at Kyushu University Hospital. Both
PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression were evaluated by immunohistochemistry. The cutoff
value for PD-L2 positivity was set at 1% according to a time-dependent receiver
operating characteristic curve for 5-year survival.
RESULTS: Of the 433 patients, 306 (70.7%) were positive for PD-L2. No significant
association between PD-L1 and PD-L2 expression was observed (P = 0.094). The
multivariate analysis showed that the independent predictors of PD-L2 positivity 
were never-smoker status (P = 0.002), poor differentiation grade (P = 0.008), and
advanced stage (P = 0.048). The PD-L2-positive patients had significantly shorter
disease-free survival (DFS) (P = 0.018) and overall survival (OS) (P = 0.016).
Both PD-L1 and PD-L2 positivity were independent predictors of OS (P < 0.001 and 
P = 0.027, respectively). In the subgroup analysis of the PD-L1-negative
patients, PD-L2 positivity was significantly associated with shorter DFS
(P = 0.018).
CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that the clinical characteristics of patients
with PD-L1 expression may differ from those of patients with PD-L2 expression,
and that both might contribute to poor prognoses. The potential role of PD-L2
expression as a predictive biomarker for response to immunotherapy should be
investigated in future studies.

Ehm2 [also known as erythrocyte membrane protein band 4.1‑like protein 4B
(EPB41L4B)] is a member of the NF2/ERM/4.1 superfamily. The overexpression of
Ehm2 has been observed in metastatic cancer cells. Through alternative splicing, 
the Ehm2 gene produces two transcript variants that encode the two different
isoforms, Ehm2/1 and Ehm2/2. The biological functions of these different Ehm2
transcript variants remain unclear. The present study aimed to determine the
expression of the Ehm2 variants in lung adenocarcinoma and their involvement in
the disease progression of the patients. The expression of Ehm2 transcript
variants in human lung adenocarcinoma tissues was analyzed using
immunohistochemistry and western blot analysis. Ehm2 variants were overexpressed 
or knocked down in A549 human lung adenocarcinoma cells. The consequent effects
of the genetic modifications on the cellular functions of lung cancer cells were 
then examined using in vitro cell viability, invasion and migration assays. The
expression of epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related markers was
evaluated by western blot analysis in the cell models. The association of Ehm2
variant expression with patient survival was analyzed using Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis. The expression of Ehm2/1 was significantly decreased in lung cancers
compared with the paired normal lung tissues (P<0.05), while the Ehm2/2 protein
levels were higher in the tumors than in the paired normal lung tissues, although
this was not statistically significant. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 exerted
inhibitory effects, while the knockdown of Ehm2/1 promoted the growth, invasion
and migration of A549 cells in vitro. Ehm2/2 was expressed at low levels in the
A549 cells and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 significantly increased the
invasiveness and migration of the A549 cells. Immunofluorescence staining
revealed that Ehm2/1 was confined to the plasma membrane, while Ehm2/2 was
observed at both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm. The overexpression of Ehm2/1 
resulted in the upregulation of the epithelial marker, E‑cadherin, and in the
decreased expression of the mesenchymal markers, N‑cadherin and Snail1, while the
knockdown of Ehm2/1 and the enforced expression of Ehm2/2 had the opposite
effects on the protein levels of EMT‑related markers. Kaplan‑Meier survival
analysis revealed that higher Ehm2/1 transcript levels were associated with the
longer survival of patients with lung adenocarcinoma, while the lower expression 
of Ehm2/2 exhibited a similar association with patient survival. Taken together, 
the two Ehm2 variants appear to be differentially expressed in lung
adenocarcinoma. Ehm2/1 may function as a putative tumor suppressor in the disease
progression of lung adenocarcinoma, while Ehm2/2 may have an opposite function.

Lung cancer is a complex disease involving multiple genetic and phenotypic
alterations. As a histone modification enzyme, protein‑arginine deiminase type‑4 
(PADI4) and its downstream signaling have been studied in the progression of a
variety of types of human cancer, but data on PADI4‑mediated posttranslational
modification in lung cancer are lacking. The aim of present study was to evaluate
the expression of PADI4 and its associated molecular signaling in lung cancer
metastasis. The results of the present study indicated that PADI4 was
overexpressed in lung cancer cells, while knockdown of PADI4 could lead to
attenuation of the lung cancer cell invasion and migration phenotype, which was
further verified by determining the epithelial‑mesenchymal transition (EMT)
marker proteins. Additionally, it was demonstrated that stable knockdown of PADI4
in A549 lung cancer cells resulted in a striking reduction of the EMT‑associated 
Snail1/mothers against decapentaplegic homolog 3/4 transcriptional complex, which
was consistent with alterations in migratory and invasive phenotypes of A549 lung
cancer cells. Therefore, PADI4‑mediated EMT transition is proposed to represent a
novel mechanism underlying the epigenetic and phenotypic alterations in lung
cancer cells, and the PADI4 associated signaling pathway may be a therapeutic
target for treating lung cancer in a clinical setting.

BACKGROUND: HOTTIP, a long non-coding RNA located in the HOXA cluster, plays a
role in the patterning of tissues with mesodermal components, including the lung.
Overexpression of HOXA genes, including HOTTIP, has been associated with a more
aggressive phenotype in several cancers. However, the prognostic impact of HOTTIP
has not yet been explored in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We have
correlated HOTTIP expression with time to relapse (TTR) and overall survival (OS)
in early-stage NSCLC patients.
METHODS: Ninety-nine early-stage NSCLC patients who underwent surgical resection 
in our center from June 2007 to November 2013 were included in the study. Mean
age was 66; 77.8% were males; 73.7% had stage I disease; and 55.5% had
adenocarcinoma. A validation data set comprised stage I-II patients from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) Research Network.
RESULTS: HOTTIP was expressed in all tumor samples and was overexpressed in
squamous cell carcinoma (p = 0.007) and in smokers (p = 0.018). Patients with
high levels of HOTTIP had shorter TTR (78.3 vs 58 months; p = 0.048) and shorter 
OS (81.2 vs 61 months; p = 0.023) than those with low levels. In the multivariate
analysis, HOTTIP emerged as an independent prognostic marker for TTR (OR: 2.05,
95%CI: 1-4.2; p = 0.05), and for OS (OR: 2.31, 95%CI: 1.04-5.1; p = 0.04). HOTTIP
was validated as a prognostic marker for OS in the TCGA adenocarcinoma cohort
(p = 0.025). Moreover, we identified a 1203-mRNA and a 61-miRNA signature that
correlated with HOTTIP expression.
CONCLUSIONS: The lncRNA HOTTIP can be considered a prognostic biomarker in
early-stage NSCLC.

Early elevation of inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6 or TNF-α, or CRP, which
is a surrogate marker for IL-6, following commencement of PD-1/L1 inhibitors
(PD1-I) may represent early activation of immune-cells. Serum IL-6 and TNF-α were
measured in 10 non-small cell lung cancer patients who were evaluable within the 
7 days before and after commencement of PD1-I. For CRP, medical records were
reviewed and 34 patients with measured CRP within the 7 days before and after the
treatment were evaluated. In the 10 patients analyzed for IL-6/TNF-α, the serum
levels of IL-6/TNF-α were not significantly different between pre- and
post-initial PD1-I [IL-6 20.3 (2.6-49.9) and 22.9 (3.6-96.1) pg/mL, p = 0.453;
TNF-α 1.6 (0.7-6.3) and 3.3 (0.7-9.6) pg/mL, p = 0.329]; however, all four
responses were observed among the 7 IL-6-elevated cases, resulting in a response 
rate of 57%. In the 34 patients analyzed for CRP, CRP was significantly increased
after initial PD1-I [1.8 (0.1-17.8) mg/dL, 2.4 (0.0-27.8), p = 0.001]. Notably,
in the 31 evaluable cases, all responses were again observed in either the IL-6
or CRP elevated groups and the response rate was 46% (11 of 24). The median
overall survival time was not reached in the elevated group and was 112 days in
the non-elevated group (p = 0.069). The early increase in inflammatory cytokines 
with PD1-I was indicated to be predictive for the efficacy in patients with
non-small cell lung cancer.

Treatment of advanced-stage or metastatic non-small-cell lung cancers (NSCLCs)
without EGFR mutations or ALK rearrangements, which can now be treated with
molecularly targeted therapies, had been based on cytotoxic chemotherapy for a
long time. Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), notably antibodies directed
against programmed cell-death protein-1 (PD-1) and its ligand (PD-L1) have
transformed therapeutic standards in thoracic oncology. These ICIs are now the
reference second-line treatment and numerous phase III trials have examined their
efficacy in treatment-naïve patients. First-line pembrolizumab monotherapy was
validated for patients with ≥ 50% of tumor cells expressing PD-L1; pembrolizumab,
atezolizumab, and nivolumab have obtained good outcomes in combination with
chemotherapy or another immunotherapy. However, in this context, other phase III 
trials yielded negative findings for nivolumab alone (CheckMate-026) or in
combination (MYSTIC trial). Biomarkers, such as PD-L1 and the tumor mutation
burden (TMB), enable better selection of patients who should benefit the most
from first-line ICI use.

In lung cancer, antiangiogenic strategies targeting tumor-derived endothelial
cells (TECs) afford a survival advantage, but the characteristics of TECs have
not been comprehensively elucidated. Herein, high-purity (> 98%) TECs were
obtained, and these cells retained expression of EC markers and exhibited high
viability. ITRAQ-2DLC-MS/MS was performed to profile the proteome and the
heterogeneity of ECs. Only 31 of 1820 identified proteins were differentially
expressed between adenocarcinoma (ADC)- and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC)-derived
TECs (TEC-A and TEC-S, respectively), and cadherin-2 (CDH2) was the most
significantly upregulated protein in TEC-A samples. Positive immunostaining for
CDH2 (score > 3) was significantly more frequent in the endothelium of ADC
tissues than in that of SCC tissues. Loss- or gain-of-function analysis showed
that CDH2 significantly promoted in vitro and in vivo angiogenesis and
sensitivity to the antagonist exherin. The MAPK/ERK and MAPK/JNK signaling
pathways may play crucial roles in CDH2-induced HIF-1α/VEGF-mediated
angiogenesis. Moreover, high CDH2 expression in TECs was significantly associated
with tumor stage, visceral pleural metastasis, and decreased overall survival in 
patients with ADC but not SCC. Together, these data indicate the importance of
CDH2 in angiogenesis and highlight its potential both for antiangiogenic therapy 
and as a candidate prognostic marker for ADC.

Background: Lung immune prognostic index (LIPI) was recently developed on the
basis of the combination of baseline derived neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio
(dNLR) and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH). This index was demonstrated as a specific
biomarker of immune checkpoint inhibitors for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
We aimed to show that LIPI may be a useful biomarker of cytotoxic chemotherapy
and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) for
NSCLC.
Methods: We retrospectively collected 175 wild-type EGFR adenocarcinomas, 131
NSCLCs harboring mutant EGFR and 110 squamous cell carcinomas. All patients
initiated first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy or EGFR-TKI monotherapy between July 
2007 and August 2017 at our hospital. These patients were divided into good,
intermediate and poor LIPI groups. We compared their overall survival (OS) and
progression-free survival (PFS). Multivariate analyses detected prognostic and
predictive factors of OS and PFS.
Results: The good LIPI group survived longer than the intermediate and poor LIPI 
groups in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (good, intermediate and poor LIPI groups:
median 19.6, 11.5 and 3.3 months, P < 0.01, respectively) and mutant EGFR NSCLC
(45.4, 25.6 and 15.7 months, P < 0.01). The PFS of good LIPI group was
significantly longer that those of the other two groups in mutant EGFR NSCLC
(16.6, 12.6 and 8.3 months, P < 0.01). The intermediate group (hazard ratio (HR) 
1.49, 95% confidential interval (CI) 1.03 - 2.15, P = 0.04) of wild-type EGFR
adenocarcinoma, intermediate (HR 2.30, 95% CI 1.33 - 3.99, P < 0.01) and poor (HR
2.76, 95% CI 1.03 - 7.42, P = 0.04) groups of mutant EGFR NSCLC were independent 
prognostic factors of poor OS. The intermediate (HR 1.57, 95% CI 1.01 - 2.44, P =
0.04) and poor (HR 2.63, 95% CI 1.14 - 6.07, P = 0.02) groups were significant
prognostic factors of PFS of mutant EGFR NSCLC.
Conclusions: LIPI was an independent prognostic factor of chemotherapy for
adenocarcinoma with wild-type EGFR and of EGFR-TKI for NSCLC harboring mutant
EGFR. Thus, LIPI was not a specific biomarker for ICI therapy, but a useful
biomarker for chemotherapy and EGFR-TKI therapy in specific subsets of NSCLC.

Gustave Roussy Immune Score Is a Prognostic Factor for Chemotherapy-Naive
Pulmonary Adenocarcinoma With Wild-Type Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor.

Author information: 
(1)Department of Respiratory Medicine, Osaka Police Hospital, Osaka 543-0035,
Japan.

Background: The Gustave Roussy Immune Score (GRIm-Score) was developed based on
the Royal Marsden Hospital (RMH) prognostic score for the purpose of a better
patient selection for immunotherapy phase I trials. This scoring system is simply
calculated by neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and
serum albumin concentration. The aim of our study was to determine whether
GRIm-Score is a practically useful prognostic biomarker for advanced non-small
cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients treated with cytotoxic chemotherapy or
epidermal growth factor receptor-tyrosine kinase inhibitor (EGFR-TKI).
Methods: This retrospective and single institutional study collected 185
adenocarcinomas without active EGFR mutation, 115 squamous cell carcinomas
treated with first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy, and 140 NSCLCs with mutant EGFR
treated with first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI monotherapy. These treatments
were initiated between July 2007 and March 2018 at our hospital. We compared
overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) between high and low
GRIm-Score groups. Using multivariate Cox proportional hazard analyses, we also
found prognostic factors of survival times.
Results: The OS and PFS of low GRIm-Score group were significantly longer than
those of high-score group in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma (low vs. high; median 
OS, 18.4 vs. 5.1 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS, 5.8 vs. 3.7 months, P = 0.01) 
and EGFR-mutant NSCLC (median OS, 38.9 vs. 10.4 months, P < 0.01, and median PFS,
15.9 vs. 5.0 months, P < 0.01). Subsequent multivariate analyses detected high
GRIm-Score in wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma as a poor prognostic factor of OS
(hazard ratio (HR) 2.20, 95% CI 1.47 - 3.31, P < 0.01), and in the EGFR-mutant
NSCLC as a poor prognostic factor of PFS (HR 1.89, 95% CI 1.00 - 3.55, P =
0.049).
Conclusions: High GRIm-Score was an independent prognostic biomarker of OS of
first-line cytotoxic chemotherapy for wild-type EGFR adenocarcinoma and of PFS of
first- or second-generation EGFR-TKI for EGFR-mutant NSCLC. Therefore, GRIm-Score
is not only a specific selection marker for experimental immunotherapy trials,
but may also be a promising and useful pretreatment prognostic maker for specific
NSCLC subsets in the real-world practice.

Formenti et al. have recently reported the clinical outcomes and translational
readouts of a trial of the anti-CTLA-4 inhibitor, ipilimumab, in combination with
palliative radiotherapy in 39 patients with non-small cell lung cancer. A
radiological response was seen in 18% of patients and 31% of patients experienced
disease control. These clinical outcomes appear to be superior to historical
studies using ipilimumab alone and suggest that radiation may have triggered
systemic, so-called abscopal, immune responses in some patients. Induction of
interferon-beta (IFN-β) and maximal expansion and contraction of distinct T cell 
receptor clones were the most significant factors predicting response.
Importantly, established predictive biomarkers of response to immunotherapy
alone, including the expression of PD-L1 in diagnostic biopsies and tumour
mutational burden, did not predict response. The report provides important human 
qualification of pre-clinical mechanistic insights indicating that abscopal
responses can be generated with optimised radiotherapy fractionation schedules
and anti-CTLA-4 inhibition. Additionally, an intriguing mechanism by which
radiation can be immunogenic is described, namely radiation-induced
transcriptional upregulation of neo-antigens.

Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death worldwide, and the current 
therapy seems to have reached a plateau due to toxicities and acquired
resistance. Therefore, exploration of novel therapeutic avenues may be useful. Si
Jun Zi Tang (SJZ), a four-herb Chinese medicine formula first described
approximately one thousand years, is often prescribed for cancer patients as a
complementary therapy. However, whether SJZ benefits cancer patients as well as
the main active constituents and its regulatory mechanism in combination with
anticancer drugs remains unknown. Here, we investigated the anti-lung cancer
potency and underlying mechanisms of the combination of gefitinib plus SJZ in
mice with Lewis lung carcinoma (LLC), using histopathology and an integrated
strategy of metabolomics and network pharmacology. The results showed that SJZ
significantly enhanced gefitinib suppressing tumor growth and inhibiting LLC
metastasis in LLC-bearing mice. Furthermore, 9 potential metabolomics biomarkers 
that differentially expressed in the SJZ/gefitinib group compared to the SJZ
group or gefitinib group were identified by untargeted metabolomics, mainly
involved three pathways: tricarboxylic acid cycle, tyrosine and tryptophan
biosynthesis metabolism and linoleic acid metabolism. Five active ingredients,
kaempferol, ginsenoside Rf, caprylic acid, lauric acid and naringenin, acted
directly on 9 targets and regulated 4 out of 9 metabolites. Our results indicated
that SJZ enhanced the anti-lung cancer effects of gefitinib via the key targets
ABCG2, ABCC1, ABAT, GSR, CYP1A2, ALOX5, CYP3A4, PLA2G1B and PLA2G2A and the key
metabolites 2-oxoglutarate, taurocholic acid, oxidized glutathione and linoleic
acid. This work illustrated the modulatory properties of SJZ, which enhanced the 
anticancer effects of gefitinib, using metabolomics and network pharmacology
analyses, and provided insights into underlying the mechanism the active
ingredients of SJZfor the treatment of lung cancer in combination with gefitinib.

BACKGROUND: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) accounts for 10-15% of all lung
malignancies and its prognosis is dismal. Although early studies have shown
promising clinical activity of immune checkpoint blockers, the immune composition
and expression of potentially actionable immunostimulatory targets in this
malignancy are poorly understood.
METHODS: Using multiplexed quantitative immunofluorescence (QIF), we measured the
levels of 3 different B7 family ligands PD-L1, B7-H3, B7-H4 and major tumor
infiltrating lymphocyte (TIL) subsets in 90 SCLC samples represented in tissue
microarray format. Associations between the marker levels, clinicopathological
variables and survival were studied.
RESULTS: PD-L1 protein was detected in 7.3%, B7-H3 in 64.9% and B7-H4 in 2.6% of 
SCLC cases. The markers showed limited co-expression and were not associated with
the level of TILs, age, gender and stage. Elevated B7-H4 was associated with
shorter 5-year overall survival. The levels of CD3+, CD8+ and CD20+ TILs and the 
ratio of total/effector T-cells were significantly lower in SCLC than in
non-small cell lung cancer. High levels of CD3+, but not CD8+ or CD20+ TILs were 
significantly associated with longer survival.
CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, our study indicate variable expression and clinical 
role of B7-family ligands in SCLC with predominant expression of the candidate
target B7-H3 and the presence of a limited cytotoxic anti-tumor immune response. 
These results support the evaluation of B7-H3 blockers and/or pro-inflammatory
therapies in SCLC.

p53 loss does not permit escape from BrafV600E-induced senescence in a mouse
model of lung cancer.

Lung cancer arises through the acquisition of a number of genetic lesions, with a
preponderance of activating mutations in the canonical mitogen-activated protein 
kinase (MAPK) cascade (RTK-RAS-RAF-MEK). BrafV600E expression induces benign lung
adenomas that fail to progress to adenocarcinoma because of oncogene-induced
senescence (OIS). BrafV600E expression, coupled with simultaneous p53 ablation,
permits bypass of senescence and progression to lung adenocarcinoma. However,
spontaneous human tumors sustain mutations in a temporally separated manner.
Here, we use a mouse lung cancer model where oncogene activation (BrafV600E
expression) and tumor suppressor loss (p53 ablation) are independently controlled
through the actions of Flp and Cre recombinase, respectively. We show that p53
loss before OIS is permissive for the transition from lung adenoma to
adenocarcinoma. In contrast, p53 loss after senescence is established fails to
enable escape from senescence and disease progression. This study demonstrates
that BrafV600E induced senescence is irreversible in vivo and suggests that
therapy-induced senescence would halt further tumor progression.

Purpose: Mutation of the Kirsten ras sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) and
loss of p53 function are commonly seen in patients with non-small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC). Combining therapeutics targeting these tumor-defensive pathways
with cisplatin in a single-nanoparticle platform are rarely developed in
clinic.Experimental Design: Cisplatin was encapsulated in liposomes, which
multiple polyelectrolyte layers, including siKRAS and miR-34a were built on to
generate multifunctional layer-by-layer nanoparticle. Structure, size, and
surface charge were characterized, in addition to in vitro toxicity studies. In
vivo tumor targeting and therapy was investigated in an orthotopic lung cancer
model by microCT, fluorescence imaging, and immunohistochemistry.Results: The
singular nanoscale formulation, incorporating oncogene siKRAS, tumor-suppressor
stimulating miR-34a, and cisplatin, has shown enhanced toxicity against lung
cancer cell line, KP cell. In vivo, systemic delivery of the nanoparticles
indicated a preferential uptake in lung of the tumor-bearing mice. Efficacy
studies indicated prolonged survival of mice from the combination
treatment.Conclusions: The combination RNA-chemotherapy in an LbL formulation
provides an enhanced treatment efficacy against NSCLC, indicating promising
potential in clinic. Clin Cancer Res; 23(23); 7312-23. ©2017 AACR.

BACKGROUND Lung cancer is among the most common causes of cancer-related deaths
worldwide, but its tumorigenic mechanisms are largely unknown. Long non-coding
RNAs (LncRNAs) have been shown to have significant roles in multiple cancers.
Herein, we aimed to elucidate the detailed effects of a newly-discovered LncRNA, 
termed PRAL, on cell proliferation in lung cancer. MATERIAL AND METHODS A total
of 100 lung cancer patients were subjected to RT-PCR analysis to detect the
expressions of PRAL. Western blot analysis was performed to examine P53 protein
levels. PRAL plasmid and specific siRNA against P53 was transfected into lung
cancer cell lines NCI-H929 and A549. Cell viability assay was conducted in the
presence or absence of siP53. RESULTS The transcript level of PRAL in human lung 
cancer was remarkably decreased in vivo compared with their adjacent
non-cancerous counterparts, and the protein levels of P53 were accordingly
suppressed. Moreover, the expression of PRAL was also decreased in all of the 5
lung cancer cell lines. Transfection of PRAL plasmid inhibited cell proliferation
in NCI-H929 and A549 cells and promoted the transcription of P53; however,
knockdown of P53 caused no notable effects on PRAL transcription, but it retarded
the inhibitory effects mediated by PRAL. CONCLUSIONS The transcript level of PRAL
was decreased in lung cancer in vivo and in vitro. Overexpression of PRAL
inhibited cell proliferation by upregulating the expression of P53. Our results
indicate that PRAL might be a tumor suppressor in lung cancer and thus provides
novel clues for the diagnosis and treatment for lung cancer in clinical practice.

BACKGROUND/AIMS: p53 dysfunction is frequently observed in lung cancer. Although 
restoring the tumour suppressor function of p53 is recently approved as a
putative strategy for combating cancers, the lack of understanding of the
molecular mechanism underlying p53-mediated lung cancer suppression has limited
the application of p53-based therapies in lung cancer.
METHODS AND RESULTS: Using RNA sequencing, we determined the transcriptional
profile of human non-small cell lung carcinoma A549 cells after treatment with
two p53-activating chemical compounds, nutlin and RITA, which could induce A549
cell cycle arrest and apoptosis, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis of
genome-wide gene expression data showed that distinct transcription profiles were
induced by nutlin and RITA and 66 pathways were differentially regulated by these
two compounds. However, only two of these pathways, 'Adherens junction' and 'Axon
guidance', were found to be synthetic lethal with p53 re-activation, as
determined via integrated analysis of genome-wide gene expression profile and
short hairpin RNA (shRNA) screening. Further functional protein association
analysis of significantly regulated genes associated with these two synthetic
lethal pathways indicated that GSK3 played a key role in p53-mediated A549 cell
apoptosis, and then gene function study was performed, which revealed that GSK3
inhibition promoted p53-mediated A549 cell apoptosis in a p53 post-translational 
activity-dependent manner.
CONCLUSION: Our findings provide us with new insights regarding the mechanism by 
which p53 mediates A549 apoptosis and may cast light on the development of more
efficient p53-based strategies for treating lung cancer.

OBJECTIVE: Programmed cell death ligand-1 interacts with the immune receptors on 
the surface of CD8+ tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and PD-1, thereby blocking its
anti-tumor activity. Therapeutics suppression of this interaction will show a
promise in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer by restoring the
functional anti-tumor T-cell activity. We aimed to evaluate the association
between the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1, stromal CD8+ tumor
infiltrating lymphocytes and p53 with the clinicopathological characteristics,
response to chemotherapy, progression-free-survival, and overall survival.
MATERIAL AND METHOD: We examined the immunohistochemical expression of PD-L1,
stromal CD8+ TILs, and p53 expression in 50 patients with advanced stage (III&IV)
non-small cell lung cancer.
RESULTS: PD-L1 was expressed in 56% of the studied cases. PD-L1 expression was
related to unfavorable response to the therapy without significant difference.
PD-L1 expression was significantly associated with disease progression, poor
progression-free-survival & overall survival. CD8+ TILs were high in 32% of the
cases. Tumors with high CD8+ TILs showed a partial response to therapy and had a 
better progression-free-survival and overall survival. p53 expressed in 82% of
the studied cases. There was a significant negative association between PD-L1 and
CD8+ TILs (p=0.009), while a non-significant association was found between p53
and PD-L1 (p=0.183).
CONCLUSION: PD-L1 overexpression is an unfavorable prognostic marker, while the
high CD8 + TILs is a good prognostic marker in non-small cell lung cancer. PD-L1 
immunohistochemical assessment may be used for the selection of patients legible 
for treatment with anti-PD-L1 therapy.

AIMS: To carry out a meta-analysis on the relationship between smoking and p53
gene mutation in lung cancer patients.
MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, ProQest and Medline were searched 
by using the key words: 'lung cancer or lung neoplasm or lung carcinoma', 'p53
mutation' and 'smoking'. According to the selection criteria, 15 articles were
identified and methodologically analysed by stata 12.0 software package. Crude
odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals calculated using the fixed-effects
model were used to assess the strength of association between smoking and p53
mutation in lung cancer.
RESULTS: In total, 15 articles with 1770 lung cancer patients were identified;
69.6% of the patients were smokers, 30.4% were non-smokers. Overall, smokers with
lung cancer had a 2.70-fold (95% confidence interval 2.04-3.59) higher risk for
mutation than the non-smokers with lung cancer. In subgroup analyses, the
increased risk of p53 mutation in smokers than in non-smokers was found in the
non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) group (odds ratio = 2.38, 95% confidence
interval = 1.71-3.32) and in the NSCLC and SCLC group (odds ratio = 3.82, 95%
confidence interval = 2.19-6.69).
CONCLUSIONS: This meta-analysis strongly suggests that p53 mutation is associated
with smoking-induced lung cancer. Smokers with lung cancer had a higher risk for 
p53 mutation than non-smokers.

Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), comprising 85% of lung cancer cases, has been
associated with resistance to chemo/radiotherapy. The hypoxic tumor
micro-environment, where insufficient vasculature results in poor drug penetrance
and sub-optimal chemotherapy in the tumor interiors contributes heavily to this
resistance. Additionally, epigenetic changes in tumorigenic cells also change
their response to different forms of therapy. In our study, we have investigated 
the effectiveness of a combination of cisplatin with scriptaid [a pan-Histone
Deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi)] in a model that mimics the tumor microenvironment 
of hypoxia and sub-lethal chemotherapy. Scriptaid synergistically increases the
efficacy of cisplatin in normoxia as well as hypoxia, accompanied with reduced
metastasis and enhanced DNA damage. Addition of scriptaid also overcomes the
cisplatin resistance exhibited in lung cancer cells with stabilized hypoxia
inducible factor 1 (HIF1)-α (mutant) and mutant p53. Molecular studies showed
that the combination treatment increased apoptotic cell death in both normoxia
and hypoxia with a dual role of p38MAPK. Together, our results suggest that the
combination of low dose cisplatin and scriptaid is cytotoxic to NSCLC lines, can 
overcome hypoxia induced resistance and mutant p53- induced instability often
associated with this cancer, and has the potential to be an effective therapeutic
modality.

p53 helps in maintaining genomic stability by undergoing cellular arrest, DNA
repair or cellular apoptosis during DNA damage. So, as to find the association of
p53Arg 72 Pro towards lung carcinogenesis and overall survival of North Indian
lung cancer patients, single nucleotide polymorphic variant (rs1042522) was
analyzed. 840 subjects including 420 cases and 420 controls were recruited and
genotyped using PCR-RFLP technique for p53Arg 72 Pro polymorphic site.
Association was analyzed using adjusted odds ratio along with its confidence
intervals (95 % CI) and p value predicted from logistic regression whereas
overall survival for lung cancer patients was obtained using Kaplan-Meir and Cox 
regression model for different parameters to obtain hazard ratio and survival
time with statistical significance (log-rank p value). None of the variant
genotypes for p53Arg 72 Pro showed any association towards lung cancer risk or
any specific histological subtype. Lung cancer subjects with Pro/Pro genotype had
better median survival time as compared to Arg/Pro genotype (10 months;
HR = 0.65; 95 % CI = 0.45-0.95; p = 0.03). Furthermore, female lung cancer
patients with Arg/Pro (HR = 0.08; 95 % CI = 0.02-0.34; p = 0.0005) and Pro/Pro
(HR = 0.21; 95 % CI = 0.06-0.67; p = 0.008) genotypes showed a better overall
survival and hence a better prognosis as compared to males. Our data also reveals
that lung cancer patients with ECOG scores between 0 and 1 and carrying the
Pro/Pro had better chances of survival. p53 codon 72 polymorphism could play a
role as a prognostic marker in lung cancer patients.

BACKGROUND: Many researches aiming to explore the pathogenesis of lung cancer
have extensively studied the molecular alteration in such disease.
OBJECTIVE: In the present study we measured the blood E2F3 mRNA using real-time
RT-PCR technique in order to evaluate its clinical significance in early
diagnosis and monitoring of lung cancer.
METHODS: This case-control study included 50 lung cancer patients, 20 patients
with benign lung diseases and 20 healthy controls. Relative quantification of
blood E2F3 mRNA was done by real-time RT-PCR.
RESULTS: Blood E2F3 mRNA levels were significantly higher in lung cancer patients
when compared to either patients with benign lung diseases or healthy subjects.
This elevation was significant in those with metastatic lung cancer as compared
to those with localized lung cancer. At a cutoff^{(2-Δ Δ CT)} 1.5, blood E2F3
mRNA was able to distinguish malignant from benign lung conditions with a
diagnostic sensitivity of 100%; while at a cutoff^{(2-Δ Δ CT)} 5.3, blood E2F3
mRNA discriminated localized from metastatic lung cancer with a sensitivity of
93.6%.
CONCLUSIONS: Blood E2F3 mRNA is a sensitive diagnostic marker in lung cancer;
moreover, it is a promising prognostic marker capable of efficiently
discriminating early from late stages of the disease.

BACKGROUND: Aberrant microRNA expression has been implicated in metastasis of
cancers. MiR-661 accelerates proliferation and invasion of breast cancer and
ovarian cancer, while impedes that of glioma. Its role in non small cell lung
cancer (NSCLC) and underlying mechanism are worthy elucidation.
METHODS: Expression of miR-661 was measured with real-time PCR in both NSCLC
tissues and cell lines. The effects of miR-661 on migration, invasion and
metastasis capacity of NSCLC were evaluated using wound healing, transwell assay 
and animal models. Dual reporter luciferase assay and complementary experiments
were performed to validate RB1 as a direct target of miR-661 for participation in
the progression of NSCLC.
RESULTS: MiR-661 was upregulated in NSCLC tissues as compared to paired adjacent 
tissues and associated with shorter overall survival. Furthermore, miR-661
promoted proliferation, migration and metastasis of NSCLC. Then, we identified
RB1 as a direct target of miR-661 through which miR-661 affected EMT process and 
metastasis of NSCLC. RB1 interacted with E2F1 and both could mediate EMT process 
in NSCLC.
CONCLUSION: MiR-661 promotes metastasis of NSCLC through RB/E2F1 signaling and
EMT events, thus may serves as a negative prognostic factor and possible target
for treatment of NSCLC patient.

Objection: The aim of this study is to investigate the association between
promoter methylation of RASSF1A and p16 and the clinicopathological features in
lung cancers.MATERIALS AND METHODS: PubMed, EBSCO, Ovid, Wiley, Web of Science,
Wanfang, and VIP databases were searched using combinations of keywords related
to RASSF1A, p16, methylation, and lung cancers. After screening for relevant
studies, following a strict inclusion and exclusion criteria; the selected
studies were incorporated into the present meta.analysis conducted using
Comprehensive Meta Analysis 2.0. (CMA 2.0).
RESULTS: We initially retrieved 402 studies, out which 13 studies met the
inclusion and exclusion criteria for this meta.analysis, and contained a total of
1,259. patients with lung cancers. The results of this meta.analysis showed that 
the differences in promoter methylation ratio between the lung cancer patients in
tumor, node, metastasis. (TNM) I.II and III.IV were not statistically
significant. Based on histological types, patients with adenocarcinoma. (AC) and 
squamous cell carcinoma. (SCC) showed no significant differences in the promoter 
methylation ratios of RASSF1A, while the promoter methylation ratio of p16 was
significantly higher in SCC patients compared to AC patients. Based on smoking
status, the promoter methylation ratios of both RASSF1A and p16 was significantly
higher in lung cancer patients with smoking history compared to nonsmokers.
CONCLUSION: The present meta.analysis provides convincing evidence that the
promoter methylation ratio of RASSF1A and p16 is associated with
clinicopathological features in lung cancers, and could be used as effective
biomarkers in early diagnosis in lung cancers.

DNA methylation has been reported to become a potential powerful tool for cancer 
detection and diagnosis. However, the possibilities for the application of
blood-based gene methylation as a biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC) detection and screening remain unclear. Hence, we performed this
meta-analysis to evaluate the value of gene methylation detected in blood samples
as a noninvasive biomarker in NSCLC. A total of 28 genes were analyzed from 37
case-control studies. In the genes with more than three studies, we found that
the methylation of P16, RASSF1A, APC, RARβ, DAPK, CDH13, and MGMT was
significantly associated with risks of NSCLC. The methylation statuses of P16,
RASSF1A, APC, RARβ, DAPK, CDH13, and MGMT were not linked to age, gender, smoking
behavior, and tumor stage and histology in NSCLC. Therefore, the use of the
methylation status of P16, RASSF1A, APC, RARβ, DAPK, CDH13, and MGMT could become
a promising and powerful biomarker for the detection and screening of NSCLC in
blood in clinical settings. Further large-scale studies with large sample sizes
are necessary to confirm our findings in the future.
